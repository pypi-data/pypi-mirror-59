"""TFXIO Interface.

TFXIO is the I/O abstraction for TFX. It allows TFX components / libraries to
access pipeline payload in the form of a common in-memory format (Apache Arrow
RecordBatch) regardless of the physical (at-rest) format of the payload. It also
provides an adapter (TensorAdapter) to translate a RecordBatch into TF tensors.

See
https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20191017-tfx-standardized-inputs.md
for the high-level design.
