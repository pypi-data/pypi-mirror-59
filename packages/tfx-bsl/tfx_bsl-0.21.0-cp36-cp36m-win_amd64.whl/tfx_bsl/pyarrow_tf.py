"""Import module for Pyarrow and Tensorflow."""

# We use this module to import Pyarrow or Tensorflow in tfx_bsl. This is
# needed to ensure we import tensorflow and pyarrow in correct order. Importing
# pyarrow first and then tensorflow can result in segmentation fault.
# TODO(b/137200365): Avoid doing this special handling once this is no longer
# necessary.
# Issue: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5894
