# pySDA

a python Suite for Diffusion Analysis (for python 3.5 and above)

## Intro

This package currently included the two diffusion analysis algorithms:

1. TaPiTaS: A geo-computational algorithm for exploring the structure of diffusion progression in time and space. Scientific Reports.
   https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-12852-z
2. MST-DBSCAN: Characterizing Diffusion Dynamics of Disease Clustering: A Modified Spaceâ€“Time DBSCAN (MST-DBSCAN) Algorithm. Annals of the American Association of Geographers.
   https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/24694452.2017.1407630

## Install

You can choose one of the following to install pySDA to your python environment.

### 1. download then pip install

1. download the package by clicking the green button (Clone or download), choose Download ZIP.

2. extract the zip file to your working directory

3. in cmd (where you can use pip install to the intended python environment):

   ```sh
   cd C://the/extract/directory/pysda-master
   pip install .
   ```

This should install the package to your python.

### 2.  git clone and pip install

in cmd:

```sh
cd C://a/place/you/like/
git clone https://github.com/wenlab501/pysda.git
cd pysda
pip install .
```

This is actually the exact same thing as the first option.

### 3. pip install from github

in cmd:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/wenlab501/pysda.git
```

This is also the same as above.

### 4. pip install from pypi

 in cmd:

```
pip install pysda
```

This will download the pysda from pypi.



## Dependency

- numpy, scipy: for calculations, including spatial indexing and querying
- pandas, geopandas: for data manipulation and result preparation
- shapely: deal with the geometry
- descartes, matplotlib, seaborn: for making maps
- python-dateutil: deal with the date conversion
- imageio: animated figure exporting
