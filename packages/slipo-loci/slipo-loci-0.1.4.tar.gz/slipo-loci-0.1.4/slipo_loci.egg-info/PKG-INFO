Description: ## LOCI
        
        #### Overview
        
        LOCI is a Python library providing high-level functions for exploring, mining and visualizing Points and Areas of Interest. It is under ongoing development. It currently supports the following functionalities:
        
        - Create a GeoDataFrame from POI data in a CSV file.
        - Display POIs on the map.
        - Filter POIs by category or keywords.
        - Compute and visualize statistics about POI categories or keywords.
        - Generate word clouds from POI categories or keywords.
        - Generate heatmaps from POI locations.
        - Construct and visualize a grid structure over POI locations.
        - Compute and visualize POI clusters using density-based clustering.
        - Use LDA to extract and assign topics to clusters.
        - Use of frequent itemset mining to discover frequent location sets.
