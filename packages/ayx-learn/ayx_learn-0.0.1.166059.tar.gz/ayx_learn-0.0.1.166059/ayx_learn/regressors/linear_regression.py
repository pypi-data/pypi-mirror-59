        Linear regression object constructor.

        The only differences between this implementation and sklearns are:
            1. normalize defaults to True. Normalizing variables is best practice when
            using ElasticNet since it includes weight regularization.

            2. random_state default to 10. Since random_state is not yet exposed
            through the CFML configuration panels, default seeding is necessary to
            guarantee consistency.
