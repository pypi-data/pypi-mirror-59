# Base Docker images

The `ubuntu-14.04`, `ubuntu-16.04`, `ubuntu-17.10`, and `ubuntu-18.04`
images are based on
[`resolwe/base:ubuntu-14.04`](https://hub.docker.com/r/resolwe/base/),
[`resolwe/base:ubuntu-16.04`](https://hub.docker.com/r/resolwe/base/),
[`resolwe/base:ubuntu-17.10`](https://hub.docker.com/r/resolwe/base/), and
[`resolwe/base:ubuntu-18.04`](https://hub.docker.com/r/resolwe/base/)
respectively.

These base images should be used for writing any new processes that are
considered for inclusion into Resolwe Bio.
