    This WGBS pipeline is comprised of three steps - alignment, computation of
    methylation levels, and identification of hypo-methylated regions (HMRs).

    First, reads are aligned by __WALT__ aligner. [WALT (Wildcard ALignment
    Tool)](https://github.com/smithlabcode/walt) is fast and accurate read
    mapping for bisulfite sequencing. Then, methylation level at each genomic
    cytosine is calculated using __methcounts__. Finally, hypo-methylated
    regions are identified using __hmr__. Both methcounts and hmr are part of
    [MethPipe](http://smithlabresearch.org/software/methpipe/) package.

      group:
        - name: rm_dup
          label: Remove duplicates
          type: basic:boolean
          default: true
        - name: mismatch
          label: Maximum allowed mismatches
          type: basic:integer
          default: 6
        - name: number
          label: Number of reads to map in one loop
          type: basic:integer
          required: false

            Sets the number of reads to mapping in each loop. Larger number results in program
            taking more memory. This is especially evident in paired-end mapping.
    - name: methcounts
      label: methcounts
      group:
        - name: cpgs
          label: Only CpG context sites
          type: basic:boolean
          default: false
          disabled: "methcounts.symmetric_cpgs"
          description: |
            Output file will contain methylation data for CpG context sites only. Choosing this
            option will result in CpG content report only.
        - name: symmetric_cpgs
          label: Merge CpG pairs
          type: basic:boolean
          default: true
          disabled: "methcounts.cpgs"
          description: |
            Merging CpG pairs results in symmetric methylation levels. Methylation is usually
            symmetric (cytosines at CpG sites were methylated on both DNA strands). Choosing this
            option will only keep the CpG sites data.
