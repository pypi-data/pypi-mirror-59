Description: # IlliniKey
        
        ![](image.png)
        
        Generate one time passwords (OTP) offline for UIUC Duo login.  Based heavily on [local-boilerkey](https://github.com/elnardu/local-boilerkey).
        
        # Setup and usage
        
        ```
        pip install illinikey
        illinikey
        ```
        
        Follow instructions for adding a new device.
        
        # i3 configuration
        
        Add to your i3 config to auto to auto-fill the passcode field on the Duo login screen.
        
        
        ```
        bindsym $mod+x exec sh -c "xdotool type $(illinikey)"
        ```
        
        # Caveats
        
        Key secrets are stored in `~/.cache/illinikey.json`.  An attacker with access to this file can bypass two-factor on your UIUC account.
