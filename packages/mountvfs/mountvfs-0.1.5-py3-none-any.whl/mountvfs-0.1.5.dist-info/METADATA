## Description
For the moment there are two classes in the package: `SshfsSaver` and `NfsSaver`. 
They are used to write data to a remote server via passing a writing func to`.save()` 
method. 

Any writing function must require a save path as its first argument, but since a saver 
is initialized with a target directory, there is no need to pass it in the `args`. 

## Usage example
```
import os
from mountvfs import SshfsSaver


def write(filepath, filename, text):
    with open(os.path.join(filepath, filename), 'w') as ouf:
        ouf.write(file)


MOUNT_PARAMS = {
    'user': 'test_user', 
    'server: 'test_server', 
    'remote_dir': 'path/to/mounted/remote/dir',
    'key': 'path/to/ssh/private/key',
    'target_dir': 'path/to/mounted/local/dir'
}

with SshfsSaver(**MOUNT_PARAMS) as saver:
     saver.save(write, args=('test_filename', 'test_text')) 

```
