Description: ## Description
        For the moment there are two classes in the package: `SshfsSaver` and `NfsSaver`. 
        They are used to write data to a remote server via passing a writing func to`.save()` 
        method. 
        
        Any writing function must require a save path as its first argument, but since a saver 
        is initialized with a target directory, there is no need to pass it in the `args`. 
        
        ## Usage example
        ```
        import os
        from mountvfs import Sshfs
        
        
        def write(filepath, filename, text):
            with open(os.path.join(filepath, filename), 'w') as ouf:
                ouf.write(file)
        
        
        MOUNT_PARAMS = {
            'user': 'test_user', 
            'server: 'test_server', 
            'remote_dir': 'path/to/mounted/remote/dir',
            'key': 'path/to/ssh/private/key',
            'target_dir': 'path/to/mounted/local/dir'
        }
        
        with Sshfs(**MOUNT_PARAMS) as saver:
             saver.save(write, args=('test_filename', 'test_text')) 
        
        ```
