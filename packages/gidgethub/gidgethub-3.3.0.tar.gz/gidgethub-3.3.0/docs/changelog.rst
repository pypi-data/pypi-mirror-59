3.1.0
''''''

  (thanks `Pablo Galindo <https://github.com/pablogsal>`_).

3.0.0
'''''

  not found in the headers.
- Allow authenticating as a GitHub App by using JSON web token.
  ``gidgethub.sansio.create_headers`` now accepts
  ``jwt`` argument. ``gidgethub.abc.GitHubAPI._make_request``,
  ``gidgethub.abc.GitHubAPI.getitem``, ``gidgethub.abc.GitHubAPI.getiter``,
  ``gidgethub.abc.GitHubAPI.post``, ``gidgethub.abc.GitHubAPI.patch``,
  ``gidgethub.abc.GitHubAPI.put``, and ``gidgethub.abc.GitHubAPI.delete`` now
  accept ``jwt`` and ``oauth_token`` arguments.

- gidgethub is now packaged using `flit <https://flit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

2.5.0
'''''

- Tighten type hints for parameters that have a default of ``None``
  but were not typed as ``Optional``.

- Tweak code to not change semantics but reach 100% coverage.

- Provide a human-readable string representation of
  ``gidgethub.sansio.RateLimit``.

- Use the ``message`` data as the error message
  if the ``errors`` object was not returned.

- Add the *data* keyword argument to ``gidgethub.abc.GitHubAPI.delete``.


2.4.1
'''''

- Tighten up protections against caching ineligible responses.


2.4.0
'''''

- Expand ``gidgethub.routing.Router.dispatch()``.


2.3.0
'''''

- Add support for ``application/x-www-form-urlencoded`` webhook event payloads.
  (This also allows for API calls to return this content type, although GitHub
  currently does not do that.)

- Introduce ``gidgethub.routing`` to help route webhook events to registered
  asynchronous callbacks.

- Add type hints.

- Add a *cache* argument to ``gidgethub.abc.GitHubAPI``.


2.2.0
'''''

- Introduce ``gidgethub.tornado`` to support
  `Tornado <http://www.tornadoweb.org/>`_ (thanks to
  Matthias Bussonnier and A. Jesse Jiryu Davis for the PR reviews).


2.1.0
'''''

- The default value for the *data* argument of ``gidgethub.abc.GitHubAPI.put()``
  was changed from ``""`` to ``b""``.
- All type hints were removed (due to mypy not supporting yield in an async
  function, they were not being tested as being valid).


2.0.0
'''''

- Renamed ``gidgethub.abc._sleep()`` to ``sleep()`` to make the method public.
- Renamed the "test" extra to "tests" and added the "dev" extra.
- Introduced the ``RateLimitExceeded`` exception.
- Methods on ``GitHubAPI`` no longer automatically sleep when it's
  possible that the call will exceed the user's rate limit (it's now up to the
  user to prevent from going over the rate limit).
- Made the ``[treq]`` install extra depend on ``Twisted[tls]``.


1.2.0
'''''

- ``gidgethub.sansio.Event.from_http()`` raises a ``BadRequest`` of ``415``
  instead of ``400`` when a content-type other than ``application/json``
  is provided.
- More robustly decode the body in ``gidgethub.sansio.Event.from_http()``
  (i.e. if the ``content-type`` doesn't specify ``charset``, assume ``UTF-8``).
- Changed the signature of ``gidgethub.sansio.Event`` to accept ``Any`` for
  the *data* argument.
- Fixed signature verification.


1.1.0
'''''

- Introduced ``gidgethub.treq`` (thanks to Cory Benfield).
