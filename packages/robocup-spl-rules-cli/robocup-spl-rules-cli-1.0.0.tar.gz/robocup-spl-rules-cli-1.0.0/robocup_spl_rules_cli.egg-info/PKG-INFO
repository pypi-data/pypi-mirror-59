Description: # RoboCup SPL Rules CLI
        
        Open RoboCup SPL Rules in your web browser!
        You can open rules of a particular year or default to the most recent rules.
        Rules are taken from [here](https://spl.robocup.org/downloads/).
        
        The regex should work until we hit a five digit year.
