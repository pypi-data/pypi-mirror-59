Description: ===============================================================
        XLED - unofficial control Twinkly - Smart Decoration LED lights
        ===============================================================
        
        XLED is python library and command line interface (CLI) to control Twinkly.
        Creators describe Twinkly `project page of Kickstarter`_:
        
            Twinkly is a Christmas tree light string, controlled via smartphone:
            "internet of things" meets extraordinary light effects! Created by ledworks
        
        Library and CLI are free software available under MIT license.
        
        Documentation for library can be found on https://xled.readthedocs.io.
        
        Use of library:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            >>> import xled
            >>> discovered_device = xled.discover.discover()
            >>> discovered_device.name
            'Twinkly_33AAFF'
            >>> control = xled.ControlInterface(discovered_device.ip_address, discovered_device.hw_address)
            >>> control.set_mode('movie')
            >>> control.get_mode()['mode']
            u'movie'
            >>> control.get_device_info()['number_of_led']
            105
        
        Use of CLI:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ xled on
            Looking for any device...
            Working on device: Twinkly_33AAFF
            Turned on.
        
        Unofficial documentation of private protocol and API is `available online`_.
        
        
        Why?
        ----
        
        I have Twinkly 105 LEDs starter light set. That is latest available model in
        2017: TW105S-EU. As of December 2017 there are only two ways to control lights
        - mobile app on Android or iOS or hardware button on the cord.
        
        Android application didn't work as advertised on my Xiaomi Redmi 3S phone. On
        first start it connected and disconnected in very fast pace (like every 1-2
        seconds) to the hardware. I wasn't able to control anything at all. Later I
        wanted to connect it to my local WiFi network. But popup dialog that shouldn't
        have appear never did so.
        
        Public API was `promised around Christmas 2016`_ for next season. Later update
        from October 2016 it seems `API won't be available any time soon`_:
        
            API for external control are on our dev check list, we definitely need some
            feedback from the community to understand which could be a proper core set
            to start with.
        
        It turned out that application uses HTTP to control lights. I ended up with
        capturing network traffic and `documented this private API`_. In the end I'm
        able to configure the device pretty easilly.
