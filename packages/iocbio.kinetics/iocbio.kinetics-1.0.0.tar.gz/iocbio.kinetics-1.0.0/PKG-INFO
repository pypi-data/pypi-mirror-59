Description: # Kinetics analysis program
        
        IOCBIO Kinetics is a cross-platform application for analysis of
        different traces, as described by its plugins. While originally
        developed for analysis of enzyme kinetics, the other types of traces
        can be analyzed as well.
        
        IOCBIO Kinetics is written for use by Laboratory of Systems Biology,
        Department of Cybernetics, School of Science, Tallinn University of
        Technology. At present, the software is not distributed outside the
        laboratory and its use is permitted for laboratory personnel only.
        
        ## Installation and Upgrade
        
        There are several ways to install the software. The application
        requires python3.
        
        For Linux, at present, installation using `pip` is recommended. It is
        expected that `pip` solution would work for Mac as well.
        
        For Windows, `conda` solution is recommended for users that don't have
        Python installed already. Otherwise, if using other than Anaconda
        Python, consider using `pip` solution.
        
        ### pip
        
        To be able to install PyQt5 using pip, you have to use python3.5 or
        higher. If not available in the system, you can replace `pip3` command
        below with `python3 -m pip`.
        
        To install published version, run
        
        ```
        pip3 install --user iocbio.kinetics
        ```
        This will install all dependencies and it is expected to add a command `iocbio-kinetics` into your `PATH`. 
        If the command is missing after installation, check whether the default location
        of `pip3` installation is in your path. For Linux, it should be `~/.local/bin`.
        
        To install, use the Git repository directly, for HTTPS users:
        ```
        pip3 install --user git+https://gitlab.com/iocbio/kinetics
        ```
        and for SSH users:
        ```
        python3 -m pip install --user git+ssh://git@gitlab.com/iocbio/kinetics.git
        ```
        
        
        For development, use
        
        ```
        pip3 install --user -e .
        ```
        
        in the source directory. To install the current version from the source, use
        
        ```
        pip3 install --user .
        ```
        
        Note that `--user` is recommended to avoid messing up the system
        packages.
        
        For upgrade, add `--upgrade` after install keyword. For example,
        ```
        pip3 install --upgrade --user git+https://gitlab.com/iocbio/kinetics
        ```
        or
        ```
        python3 -m pip install --upgrade --user git+ssh://git@gitlab.com/iocbio/kinetics.git
        ```
        
        ### conda (Anaconda or Miniconda3)
        
        Installation by conda is not supported at the moment. However, you can
        install Anaconda environment and then use pip3 solution above in
        Anaconda Prompt.
        
        #### Installation Anaconda
        
        Install Anaconda Python environment by downloading it from
        https://www.anaconda.com/ . The package uses Python 3 language, so,
        the version supporting it should be installed. At the moment of
        writing, its Python 3.6.
        
        #### Installation of channels
        
        For installation from GUI:
        * Start Anaconda Navigator
        * Add channels by clicking "Channels" on the main screen and adding:
            * conda-forge
        
        For installation from CLI, start Anaconda Prompt. In the prompt, add channels:
        ```
        conda config --append channels conda-forge
        conda config --append channels iocbio
        ```
        and install software
        ```
        conda install -c iocbio iocbio-kinetics
        ```
        and you are all set.
        
        
        For running iocbio.kinetics in Windows, its possible to start it as an
        application from Anaconda Navigator or, directly, from starting
        `iocbio-kinetics` in `Anaconda/Scripts` directory. For convenience, a
        shortcut can be created on desktop or Start Menu by the user.
        
        
        ## Use with R
        
        If `iocbio-banova` is used, some additional packges are needed. Install them following packages in R:
        
        ```
        install.packages(c("tidyverse", "BayesFactor"))
        ```
        
        
        ## Making packages
        
        For making source package, run
        
        ```
        python3 setup.py sdist
        ```
        
        
        For Conda packages, install conda (miniconda3 or anaconda3), `conda-build`, and run
        ```
        conda-build -c anaconda -c conda-forge .
        ```
        in `packaging/conda` subfolder.
