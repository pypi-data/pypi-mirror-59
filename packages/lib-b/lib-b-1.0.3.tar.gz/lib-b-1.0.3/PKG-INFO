Description: # LIB-B
        
        A library contains implements of factorization supporting multiple methods and data types.
        
        - LU Factorization
        - Schmidt Decomposition (classical/modified)
        - Householder Reduction
        - Givens Reduction
        
        ## Environment
        
            Python 3.4 or higher
        
        ## Install
        
        ```sh
        pip install lib-b
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        
        ```sh
        # libb -h
        ```
        
        If you have some matrix file which is split by white space:
        
        ```sh
        # libb -f matrix lu|cs|ms|h|g
        ```
        
        ## Usage in script
        
        Import it:
        
        ```python
        import libb
        ```
        
        Load matrix(from stdin or opened file):
        ```python
        A_matrix, row_num, col_num = libb.LoadMatrix(src=stdin)
        ```
        
        Apply methods on matrix (any struct that supports index operator `[]`) and fetch the result:
        
        ```python
        P, L, U = libb.LUFactorization(A=A_matrix)
        Q, R = libb.ClassicalSchmidtDecomposition(A=A_matrix)
        Q, R = libb.ModifiedSchmidtDecomposition(A=A_matrix)
        Q, R = libb.HouseholderReduction(A=A_matrix)
        Q, R = libb.GivensReduction(A=A_matrix)
        ```
