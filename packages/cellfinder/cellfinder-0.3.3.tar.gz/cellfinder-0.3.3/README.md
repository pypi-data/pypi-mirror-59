# Cellfinder
Whole-brain cell detection, registration and analysis.

---


Cellfinder is a collection of tools from the 
[Margrie Lab](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/people/troy-margrie) and
 others at the [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/)
 for the analysis of whole-brain imaging data such as 
 [serial-section imaging](https://sainsburywellcomecentre.github.io/OpenSerialSection/)
 and lightsheet imaging in cleared tissue.
 
 The aim is to provide a single solution for:
 
 * Cell detection (initial cell candidate detection and refinement using 
 deep learning.
 * Atlas registration (using [amap](https://github.com/SainsburyWellcomeCentre/amap-python))
 * Analysis of cell positions in a common space
 
Installation is with `pip install cellfinder`, but full documentation can be 
found [here](https://sainsburywellcomecentre.github.io/cellfinder).
