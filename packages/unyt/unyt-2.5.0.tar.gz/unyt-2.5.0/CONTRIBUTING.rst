Code of Conduct
---------------

The development of ``unyt`` happens in the context of the `yt community code
of conduct
<http://yt-project.org/doc/developing/developing.html#yt-community-code-of-conduct>`_.
If for any reason you feel that the code of conduct has been violated in the
context of ``unyt`` development, please send an e-mail to
confidential@yt-project.org with details describing the incident. All emails
sent to this address will be treated with the strictest confidence by an
individual who does not normally participate in yt development.

Types of Contributions
----------------------

You can contribute in many ways:

Report Bugs
~~~~~~~~~~~

Report bugs at https://github.com/yt-project/unyt/issues.

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

* Your operating system name and version.
* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

Fix Bugs
~~~~~~~~

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with "bug" and "help
wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

Implement Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with "enhancement"
and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

Write Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

unyt could always use more documentation, whether as part of the
official unyt docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts,
articles, and such.

Submit Feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at
https://github.com/yt-project/unyt/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions
  are welcome :)

Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up ``unyt`` for local development.

1. Fork the ``unyt`` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/unyt.git

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have
   virtualenvwrapper installed, this is how you set up your fork for local
   development::

    $ mkvirtualenv unyt
    $ cd unyt/
    $ python setup.py develop

4. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8, format
   the code with black, and run the tests, including testing several Python
   versions with tox::

    $ flake8 unyt
    $ black ./
    $ pytest --doctest-modules --doctest-rst --doctest-plus
    $ tox

   To get ``flake8``, ``black``, ``pytest``, ``pytest-doctestplus``, and
   ``tox``, just pip install them into your virtualenv.

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Testing unyt
------------

We use the ``pytest`` test runner as well as the ``tox`` test wrapper to manage running tests on various versions of python. To run the tests on your copy of
the ``unyt`` repository, simply run ``pytest`` in the root of the repository::

   $ cd unyt/
   $ pytest --doctest-modules --doctest-rst --doctest-plus

You will need to install ``pytest`` and ``pytest-doctestplus`` from ``pip`` to
run this command. Some tests depend on ``h5py``, ``Pint``, ``astropy``,
``black``, and ``flake8`` being installed.

If you would like to run the tests on multiple python versions, first ensure that you have multiple python versions visible on your ``$PATH``, then simply execute ``tox`` in the root of the ``unyt`` repository::

   $ cd unyt
   $ tox

The ``tox`` package itself can be installed using the ``pip`` associated with one of the python installations. See the ``tox.ini`` file in the root of the repository for more details about our ``tox`` setup. Note that you do not need to install anything besides ``tox`` and ``python`` for this to work, ``tox`` will handle setting up the test environment, including installing any necessary dependencies via ``pip``.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests for functionality that is not already
   tested. We strive for 100% test coverage and pull requests should not add any
   new untested code. Use the `codecov.io reports
   <https://codecov.io/gh/yt-project/unyt>`_ on the pull request to gauge
   coverage. You can also generate coverage reports locally by running the
   ``tox`` tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality the docs should be updated. If your
   new functionality adds new functions or classes to the public API, please add
   docstrings. If you modified an existing function or class in the public API,
   please update the existing docstrings. If you modify private implementation
   details, please use your judgment on documenting it with comments or
   docstrings.
3. The pull request should work for Python 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7. Check in the
   GitHub interface for your pull request and make sure that the tests pass for
   all supported Python versions.

Deploying
---------

A reminder for the maintainers on how to deploy.  Make sure all your changes are
committed (including an entry in HISTORY.rst and adding any new contributors to
AUTHORS.rst).  Then run::

  $ git tag v1.x.x
  $ git push upstream master --tags

Travis will then deploy to PyPI if tests pass.
