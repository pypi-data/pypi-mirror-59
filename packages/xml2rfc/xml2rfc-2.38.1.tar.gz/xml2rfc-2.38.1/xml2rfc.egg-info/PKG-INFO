Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        The IETF_ uses a specific format for the standards and other documents it
        publishes as RFCs_, and for the draft documents which are produced when
        developing documents for publications.  There exists a number of different
        tools to facilitate the formatting of drafts and RFCs according to the
        existing rules, and this tool, **xml2rfc**, is one of them.  It takes as input
        an xml file which contains the text and meta-information about author names
        etc., and transforms it into suitably formatted output.  The input xml file
        should follow the grammars in RFC7749_ (for v2 documents) or RFC7991_ (for 
        v3 documents). Note that the grammar for v3 is still being refined, and 
        changes will eventually be captured in the `bis draft for 7991`_. 
        Changes not yet captured can be seen in the xml2rfc source `v3.rng`_.
        
        **xml2rfc** provides a variety of output formats. See the command line
        help for a full list of formats. It also provides conversion from v2 to
        v3, and can run the preptool_ on its input.

        Installation
        ============
        
        Installation of the python package is done as usual with 'pip install xml2rfc',
        using appropriate switches and/or sudo.
        
        Installation of support libraries for the PDF-formatter
        -------------------------------------------------------
        
        In order to generate PDFs, xml2rfc uses the WeasyPrint module, which
        depends on external libaries that must be installed as native packages
        on your platform, separately from the xml2rfc install.
        
        First, install the Cairo, Pango, and GDK-PixBuf library files on your
        system.  See installation instructions on the WeasyPrint Docs:
        
            https://weasyprint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html
        
        (Python 3 is not needed if your system Python is 2.7, though).
        
        (On some OS X systems with System Integrity Protection active, you may
        need to create a symlink from your home directory to the library installation
        directory (often /opt/local/lib):
        
            ln -s /opt/local/lib ~/lib
        
        in order for weasyprint to find the installed cairo and pango libraries.
        Whether this is needed or not depends on whether you used macports or homebrew
        to install cairo and pango, and the homebrew / macport version.)
        
        Next, install the pycairo and weasyprint python modules using pip.
        Depending on your system, you may need to use 'sudo' or install in
        user-specific directories, using the --user switch.  On OS X in
        particular, you may also need to install a newer version of setuptools
        using --user before weasyprint can be installed.  If you install with 
        the --user switch, you may need to also set PYTHONPATH, e.g.,
        
            PYTHONPATH=/Users/henrik/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages
        
        for Python 2.7.
        
        The basic pip commands (modify as needed according to the text above)
        are:
        
            pip install 'pycairo>=1.18' 'weasyprint<=0.42.3'
        
        With these installed and available to xml2rfc, the --pdf switch will be
        enabled.
        
        For PDF output, you also need to install the Noto font set.  Download the full
        set from https://noto-website-2.storage.googleapis.com/pkgs/Noto-unhinted.zip,
        and install as appropriate for your platform.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        xml2rfc accepts a single XML document as input and outputs to one or more conversion formats.
        
        **Basic Usage**: ``xml2rfc SOURCE [options] FORMATS...``
        
        Run ``xml2rfc --help`` for a full listing of command-line options.
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        
        Version 2.38.1 (20 Jan 2020)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          * Added a preptool check for numbered sections occurring after or under
            unnumbered sections, and changed the code for Reference sections to
            not emit section numbers if the previous section was unnumbered.  
            Fixes issue #433
        
          * Refactored the code for reference anchor to display string mapping,
            locating it in a base class method.  Updated it to honour the symRefs
            setting.  Fixes issue #476.
        
          * Added installation of Python 3.8 to Dockerfile, and updated the minor
            version numbers for the other Python installation stanzas.
        
          * Fixed a problem rendering multiple authors with organization 
            showOnFrontPage='false'.  Further addresses issue #483.
        
          * Added a switch --no-external-js, and some other --no-* switches to 
            invert boolean settings.  Fixes issue #486.
        
          * Added an early return from cache() when repeated attempts to fetch an 
            URL fails.

        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          * Tweaked the preptool handling of <xref> in <toc>.  Further addresses
            issue #466, fixing an issue that could occur if a section used for
            instance <sub> or <sup>.
        
          * Fixed an off-by-one error in list indexing during text wrapping of
            first page header content.  Fixes issue #483.
        
          * Tweaked the output for <xref format='title'> when refering to Reference 
            entries.
        
          * Fixed a Py2/Py3 code compatibility issue
        
          * Tweaked the handling of <artwork type='ascii-art'> to insert '(Artwork 
            only available as ...)' text also for text content which is only whitespace.
        
          * Changed utils.isblock() to use a list of element tags derived from the 
            schema instead of a static list, to avoid discrepancies between schema
            and code.
        
          * Changed the parser's handling of inter-element blank text to keep instead 
            of remove, in order to not drop intentional blank space between for 
            instance <xref> instances.
        
          * Reverted the silencing of warnings related to postal address input.  
            Addresses issue #437.
        
          * Added code to deal better with <iref> as a direct child of <section>.  
            Fixes issue #479.
        
          * Fixed a bug where text after <iref> was lost by the text formatter.  
            Fixes issue #480
        
          * Added an option to list recognised country names for use with 
            <country>, and changed the note() emitted for unrecognized countries to a 
            warning.  Added some new alternative country strings.
        
          * Updated test masters
        
          * Fixed a problem with <author> entries with only <organization> 
            information.  Fixes issue #424.
        
          * Added a minimum width setting for tables, in order to avoid table 
            captions rendering in very narrow space when the table itself is narrow.  
            Fixes issue #482.
        
          * Avoid double space after initial when <contact> is rendered inline.  
            Fixes issue #478.
        
          * Added code to recognise another case of inconsistent table row cell 
            counts and report the issue.
        
          * Added 'P.R. China' as a recognized country name.
        
          * From Python 3.2 and later, cgi.encode() is deprecated.  Changed to use
            html.encode() instead.
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Version 2.37.3 (22 Dec 2019)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          * Undid margin-left: 0 for <dd> from the original supplied CSS, which
            caused nested lists to not have any distinction between levels.  Fixes
            issue #458.
        
          * Tweaked the margin of block elements within <aside>.  Fixes issue #469.
        
          * Added <dt> and <li> to list of block elements.  Fixes issue #453.
        
          * Treated pilcrows on sourcecode within figure the same way as artwork
            within figure (don't add a pilcrow, since the figure title already
            provides an anchor).  Fixes issue #475.
        
          * Don't use both @seriesNo and <seriesInfo> to emit series number.  Fixes 
            issue #477.
        
          * Added code to adapt the line break position for long Updates: and 
            Obsoletes: entries for long right-column entries.  Fixes issue #472.
        
          * Added normalization before the comparison that determines if <xref> 
            text content is different from derivedContent or not, and should be emitted 
            in addition to the derivedContent.  Fixes issue #466.
        
          * Fixed a case where simple derivedContent was used instead of fully 
            rendered explicit <xref> text content where available.  Fixes issue #474.
