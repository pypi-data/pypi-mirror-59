DVH Database for Clinicians and Researchers

DVH Analytics is a software application to help radiation oncology departments build an in-house database of 
treatment planning data for the purpose of historical comparisons and statistical analysis. This code is still in 
development. Please contact the developer if you are interested in testing or collaborating.

The application builds a SQL database of DVHs and various planning parameters from DICOM files (i.e., Plan, Structure, 
Dose). Since the data is extracted directly from DICOM files, we intend to accommodate an array of treatment planning 
system vendors.
