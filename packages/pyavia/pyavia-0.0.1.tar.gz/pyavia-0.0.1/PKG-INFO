Description: # PyAvia
        
        **PyAvia** is a collection of modules useful for common tasks in aerospace
        engineering or engineering in general.  
        
        - **Documentation**: <a href="https://pyavia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">PyAvia on ReadTheDocs.</a>
        - **Repository**: <a href="https://github.com/ericjwhitney/pyavia">PyAvia on
         Github</a>
        - **Current version**: 0.0.1
        
        *Important points*:
        - Development is intended to be organic.
        - Modules presently included were either previously developed during my day
        -to-day work as an engineer, or otherwise just out of curiosity.  If
         something seems like it might be useful to other people, I will try to
          include it.
        - I don't intend on including anything that is particularly arcane, buggy,
          hard to use or not for the public domain.
        
        ## Warning
        
        **CAVEAT COMPUTOR** - These modules are provided "as is", without warranty
        of any kind.  They are intended to be read and/or used by people trained
        in engineering and scientific methods who know how to verify results and
        who can recognise incorrect values when they see them... *which will
        happen frequently.*
        
        
        ## Installation
        NumPy needs to be installed prior to installing PyAvia (*because setuptools
         is not completely working*), <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/install.html">see this link</a>.
        
        Once NumPy is installed, install PyAvia using the typical pip installation
         methods, for example:
        - Using a shell with pip directly and root access:
        ```console
        $ pip install pyavia
        ```
        - Using a windows prompt as a user only: 
        ```console
        C:\> py -m pip install --user pyavia
        ```
