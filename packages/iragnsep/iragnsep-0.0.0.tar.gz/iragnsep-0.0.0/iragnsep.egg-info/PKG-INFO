Description: # iragnsep
        
        iragnsep performs IR (i.e. 8--1000 microns) SED fits to separate the AGN and the galaxy contributions allowing to measure the host galaxy properties (e.g. SFRs) free of AGN contamination. The advantage of iragnsep is that, in addition to fit observed photometric fluxes, it allows to incorporate spectra in the fits which improves the robustness at separating the AGN and the galaxy components. For the galaxy component iragnsep uses a library of templates that are representative of local star-forming galaxies. For the AGN contribution, if the input dataset contains a mixed of a spectral and photometric data, iragnsep uses a combination of power-laws for the AGN continuum and some broad features for the silicate emissions. If the dataset contains photometric data only, the AGN contribution is accounted for by using a fixed library of AGN templates representative of typical AGN emission at IR wavelengths. The advanced fitting techniques used by iragnsep (i.e. MLE optimised with MCMC) combined with the powerful model comparison tests (e.g. AIC) allow iragnsep to provide a statistically robust interpretation of the data in terms of AGN--galaxy separation for the IR emission of galaxies harbouring AGNs at their centre.
        
        The aim of this README is to show how to use iragnsep and to present the various modules used throughout. Further information concerns the limitations of iragnsep as well as future work expected to improve iragnsep. These are important to consider while using iragnsep. Any use of iragnsep out of those defined boundaries are to be done with care.
        
        For a detailed description on the templates and the models see Bernhard et al. (in prep.).

        ## Getting Started
        These instructions should assist you in getting iragnsep running on your machine. iragnsep is written in python 3 and is available on PyPI to ease installation and updates.

        ### Installation
        We recommend to install iragnsep and its dependencies using pip,
        
        ```
        pip3 install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ iragnsep
        ```
        The project is also publicly available on bitbucket at https://bitbucket.org/ebernhard/iragnsep/src/master/ .
        
        ## Quick start
        
        In this section we show how to infer the SFR of the galaxy mrk1066 using iragnsep.
        
        ### Step 1: Get the data and the script
        
        You can download the data at https://bitbucket.org/ebernhard/iragnsepex/src/master/. The file data_mrk1066.csv contains the Herschel fluxes of mrk1066 and the file data_mrk1066_spec.csv contains the IRS spectrum of mrk1066. The file main.py is the script to run. Once downloaded, create a folder with all of these files.
        
        ### Step 2: Run the script
        
        In a terminal simply cd to the folder that contains the files and run,
        
        ```
        python3 main.py
        ```
        
        iragnsep is now fitting mrk1066, first using a combination of the IRS spectra and Herschel photometry, then using photometry only as if the IRS spectra was not available. The user can open the file main.py which is commented and can be used as a template for future use of iragnsep.
        
        ### Step 3: Output
        
        Once the fit is performed the plots and tables are generated and saved in the same folder. 
        
        * **mrk1066_fitRes_spec.csv** - contains the results of the fits for all possible combinations of models. Each line corresponds to a specific model. This file is for fits based on data which include the IRS spectrum. The best model is flagged by a value of 1.0 in the column 'bestModelFlag'. See the section ** Description of the tables** for a full description of each of the columns.
        * **mrk1066_fitResAll_spec.pdf** - shows the results of each of the models fit to the data which include the IRS spectrum.
        * **mrk1066_fitResBM_spec.pdf** -  shows the best fit to the data which do not include the IRS spectrum. The best fit corresponds to a weighted combination of all the different models.
        * **mrk1066_fitRes_photo.csv** - contains the results of the fits for all possible combinations of models. Each line corresponds to a specific model. This file is for fits based on data which do not includes the IRS spectrum. The best model is flagged by a value of 1.0 in the column 'bestModelFlag'. See the section ** Description of the tables** for a full description of each of the columns.
        * **mrk1066_fitResAll_photo.pdf** - shows the results of each of the models fit to the data which do not include the IRS spectrum.
        * **mrk1066_fitResBM_photo.pdf** - shows the best fit to the data which do not include the IRS spectrum. The best fit corresponds to a weighted combination of all the different models.
        
        (Important notice: for this example the number of steps for the MCMC is set to 1000. This is way too short and should be increased to get a more reliable fit. We use 1000 here so it is not too much time consuming and the fits appear to be OK.)
        
        ## Preparing your data
        As this is the first version of iragnsep it is important to make sure that the data in input are compatible with the code. Future versions will allow more flexibility in the format of the input data. The main input are the wavelengths of the SED (or combined spectrum and photometry) and the corresponding fluxes and their uncertainties. Here is a (non-exhaustive) check list of points that are required to ensure a robust behaviour of iragnsep.
        
        * the wavelengths are in microns, the fluxes and the uncertainties are in Jy.
        * the vector wavelength is in monotonically increasing order.
        * their is no negative or undefined (e.g. nan) values in the fluxes and their uncertainties (upper-limits can be passed via the keyword UL).
        * the vectors fed in the keywords 'wavToFit', 'filters' and 'UL' are of the same length. The later is defined by the number of photometric points in the SED.
        * if any of the keywords 'wavToFit', 'filters' and 'UL' are changed, they all need to be changed accordingly (see the example of mrk1066 where there is no flux at 500 micron).
        * if using iragnsep with a combination of spectrum and photometry, make sure that no photometric points are overlapping with the spectral data (e.g. IRS spectra and MIPS 24 mic would be overlapping).
        * from practice, a good value for Nmc (the number of steps in the MCMC) is at least >10000 steps.
        * do not forget to set the redshift of the source using the keyword z.

        ## Description of the tables
        
        The output of the fits can be saved using the keyword saveRes as shown in the main.py of the Quick Start example on mrk1066. In particular two types of tables can be generated whether using the version of the code with spectra or that of with photometry only.
        
        The table sourceName_fitRes_spec.csv is a comma separated values table which contains the results of the fits performed on data which includes spectra (i.e. using the full model for AGN emission). Each line of the table is a possible model that has been fit to the data. Columns are as follow,

        The module classes contains one class called 'modelToSED' which calls various functions to return the photometric point at a given wavelengths in a given filters for a model nuLnu. The available filters are as follow:

        ## Cautionary notes
        
        As this is the first version of iragnsep we suggest the user to check carefully the results and to report anything that is possibly a bug. To do this, please contact us at: e.p.bernhard@sheffield.ac.uk.
        
        The templates and models built for iragnsep are based on observations out to z~0.3. As a consequence there is no proof that these are valid at higher redshifts. We are currently testing this and early results suggest that iragnsep can be used for sources at higher redshifts i.e. z~3. However, this is at the user's own risk.
        
        ## Future work
        
        Future version will allow a more flexible input for the observed data. In addition it will be possible for the user to choose a complete different set of templates if necessary and to use iragnsep as a fitting and analysis routine only. We also plan to increase to even higher level the robustness of the model selection by using different model testing methods.
        
        ## Versioning
        
        We use three numbers for the versions defined as x.y.z. If only y and z are changed the output of iragnsep is unchanged and minor patches are applied. If x changes it means that major changes has been applied and results are likely to differ from the x-1 version.
