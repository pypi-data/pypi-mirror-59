# Fast-convolution via overlap-save: a partial drop-in replacement for scipy.signal.fftconvolve

Features:

- 1D and 2D (both tested) and higher (untested) arrays
  - (Currently unsupported is convolving different-dimensional signals)
- Real and complex arrays
- Memory-mapped input/outputs fully supported (and tested)
- Supports alternative FFT engines such as PyFFTW
- Supports reflect-mode (signal assumed to reflect infinitely, instead of 0
  outside its support; useful for avoiding edge effects)
- Relatively straightforward to paralellize each step of the algorithm
- Extensively unit-tested

When it can be used as a drop-in replacement for `fftconvolve`:

- when you call `fftconvolve` with `mode='same'` and `axes=None`
- [See docs](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.fftconvolve.html)

Example (culled from unit tests):
```py
import numpy as np
from scipy.signal import fftconvolve

# Generate a 100x100 signal array and a 10x10 filter array
nx = 100
nh = 10
x = np.random.randint(-10, 10, size=(nx, nx)) + 1.0
h = np.random.randint(-10, 10, size=(nh, nh)) + 1.0

# Compute the linear convolution using the FFT, keeping the center 100x100 samples
expected = fftconvolve(x, h, mode='same')

# Use overlap-save, computing the output in 6x5-sized chunks. Instead of one huge FFT, we do a
# several tiny ones
from ols import ols
actual = ols(x, h, [6, 5])

# The two will match
assert np.allclose(expected, actual)
```

  `hfftconj` (i.e., the output of `prepareh`), compute a chunk of the total
  convolution. Specifically, the subarray of the total output starting at
  `starts`, with each dimension's length in `lengths`, is returned. The FFT
  length `nfft` (which was used in `prepareh`) is also required, as is `nh` the
  shape of the filter array (`h.shape`).

  For convenience, `lengths` is treated as a *maximum* length in each dimension,
  so `starts + lengths` is allowed to exceed the total size of `x`: the function
  won't read past the end of any arrays.

  The lists `starts`, `lengths`, `nft`, and `nh` are all required to be the same
  length, matching the number of dimensions of `x` and `hfftconj`.

  If `rfftn` and `irfftn` are not provided, `numpy.fft`'s functions are used.
  This can be overridden to use, e.g., PyFFTW's multi-threaded alternatives.

  `mode` and `**kwargs` are passed to `numpy.pad`, see

  """Perform multidimensional overlap-save fast-convolution.

  As mentioned in the module docstring, the output of this function will be
  within machine precision of `scipy.signal.fftconvolve(x, h, mode='same')`.

  However, rather than computing three potentially-large FFTs (one for `x`, one
  for `h`, and an inverse FFT for their product), the overlap-save algorithm
  performs a sequence of smaller FFTs. This makes it appropriate for situations
  where you may not be able to store the signals' FFTs in RAM, or even cases
  where you cannot even store the signals themselves in RAM, i.e., when you have
  to memory-map them from disk.

  `x` and `h` can be multidimensional (1D and 2D are extensively tested), but
  must have the same rank, i.e., `len(x.shape) == len(h.shape)`.

  `size` is a list of integers that specifies the sizes of the output that will
  be computed in each iteration of the overlap-save algorithm. It must be the
  same length as `x.shape` and `h.shape`. If not provided, defaults to
  `[4 * x for x in h.shape]`, i.e., will break up the output into chunks whose
  size is governed by the size of `h`.

  `nfft` is a list of integers that specifies the size of the FFT to be used.
  It's length must be equal to the length of `size`. Each element of this list
  must be large enough to store the *linear* convolution, i.e.,
  `all([nfft[i] >= size[i] + h.shape[i] - 1 for i in range(len(nfft))])`
  must be `True`. Set this to a multiple of small prime factors, which is the
  default.

  If provided, the results will be stored in `out`. This is useful for
  memory-mapped outputs, e.g.

  If not provided, `rfftn` and `irfftn` default to those in `numpy.fft`. Other
  implementations matching Numpy's, such as PyFFTW, will also work.

  By default, `mode='constant'` assumes elements of `x` outside its boundaries
  are 0, which matches the textbook definition of convolution. `mode='reflect'`
  is also supported. It should be straightforward to add support for other modes
  supported by `np.pad`. Keyword arguments in `**kwargs` are passed to `np.pad`.
