Description: # palace
        Palace is a Python 3D audio API wrapping around [alure][0].
        To quote alure's README,
        
        > It uses OpenAL for audio rendering, and provides common higher-level features
        > such as file loading and decoding, buffer caching, background streaming,
        > and source management for virtually unlimited sound source handles.
        
        ## Features
        In some sense, what palace aimes to be to OpenAL is what [ModernGL][1]
        is to OpenGL (except that all the heavy-lifting are taken are by alure):
        
        * 3D sound rendering
        * Environmental audio effects: reverb, atmospheric air absorption,
          sound occlusion and obstruction
        * Binaural (HRTF) rendering
        * Out-of-the-box audio decoding of FLAC, MP3, Ogg Vorbis, Opus, WAV, AIFF, etc.
        * Modern Pythonic API: snake_case, `@property`, `with` context manager,
          type annotation
        
        ## Installation
        ### Via PyPI
        Palace requires Python 3.6+ and [alure][0].
        Given these dependencies satisfied, palace could be installed using `pip` via
        
            pip install palace
        
        Currently only GNU/Linux is supported.  If you want to help package for
        other operating systems, please head to issue #1.
        
        ### From source
        To build from source, one will also need to have Python headers, [Cython][2],
        and a C++11 compiler (and probably `git` for fetching the source) installed.
        Palace can then be compiled and installed by running
        
        ```sh
        git clone https://github.com/McSinyx/palace
        cd palace
        python setup.py install --user
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        One may start with the `examples` for sample usage of palace.
        For further information, Python's `help` is your friend.
