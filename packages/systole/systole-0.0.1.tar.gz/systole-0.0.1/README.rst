**Systole** is an open-source Python package providing simple tools to record and analyze body signal for psychophysiology.

Installation
============

Systole can be installed using pip:

.. code-block:: shell

  pip install systole

The following package will be required to use Systole:

* Numpy (>=1.15)
* SciPy (>=1.3.0)
* Pandas (>=0.24)
* Matplotlib (>=3.0.2)
* Seaborn (>=0.9.0)

Recording
=========

Systole supports the recording of PPG signal through the `Nonin 3012LP Xpod USB pulse oximeter <https://www.nonin.com/products/xpod/>`_ together with the `Nonin 8000SM 'soft-clip' fingertip sensors <https://www.nonin.com/products/8000s/>`_.
It can easily interface with `PsychoPy <https://www.psychopy.org/>`_ to record PPG signal during psychological experiments.

Record and plot data with less than 6 lines of code.

.. code-block:: python

  import serial
  from systole.recording import Oximeter
  ser = serial.Serial('COM4')  # Add your USB port here

  # Open serial port, initialize and plot recording for Oximeter
  oxi = Oximeter(serial=ser).setup().read(duration=10)


Interfacing with PsychoPy
-------------------------

2 methods are available to record PPG signal:

* The `read()` method

Will continuously record for a certain amount of time (specified by the
`duration` parameter, in seconds). This is the easiest and most robust method,
but it is not possible to run instructions in the meantime (serial mode).

.. code-block:: python

  # Code 1 {}
  oximeter.read(duration=10)
  # Code 2 {}

* The `readInWaiting()` method

Will read all the available bytes (up to 10 seconds of recording). When
inserted into a while loop, it allows recording PPG signal in parallel with
other commands.

.. code-block:: python

  import time
  tstart = time.time()
  while time.time() - tstart < 10:
      oximeter.readInWaiting()
      # Insert code here {...}

Online detection
----------------

Online heart beat detection.

.. code-block:: python

  import serial
  import time
  from systole.recording import Oximeter

  # Open serial port
  ser = serial.Serial('COM4')  # Change this value according to your setup

  # Create an Oxymeter instance and initialize recording
  oxi = Oximeter(serial=ser, sfreq=75, add_channels=4).setup()

  # Online peak detection for 10 seconds
  tstart = time.time()
  while time.time() - tstart < 10:
      while oxi.serial.inWaiting() >= 5:
          paquet = list(oxi.serial.read(5))
          oxi.add_paquet(paquet[2])  # Add new data point
          if oxi.peaks[-1] == 1:
            print('Heartbeat detected')

Peaks detection
===============
Heart beat can be detected in the PPG signal either online or offline.

Methods from clipping correction and peak detection algorithm is adapted from [#]_.

.. code-block:: python

  # Plot data
  oxi.plot()

.. figure::  images/recording.png
   :align:   center

Artifact removal
================
It is possible to detect and correct outliers from RR time course following the method described in [#]_.

.. code-block:: python

  from systole import import_rr()
  from systole.plotting import plot_subspaces

  rr = import_rr().rr[:100]
  rr[20] = 1600  # Add missed beat

  plot_subspaces(rr)

.. figure::  images/subspaces.png
   :align:   center

Heart rate variability
======================

Time-domain
-----------

Extract the summary of time-domain indexes.

.. code-block:: python

  from systole.hrv import time_domain

  stats = time_domain(rr)
  stats

Frequency-domain
----------------
.. code-block:: python

  from systole.hrv import plot_psd

  plot_psd(rr)

.. figure::  images/psd.png
   :align:   center

Extract the summary of frequency-domain indexes.

.. code-block:: python

  from systole.hrv import frequency_domain

  frequency_domain(rr)

.. table:: Output
   :widths: auto

   +-----------+---------------+
   | *Metric*  | *Value*       |
   +-----------+---------------+


Non-linear
----------

.. code-block:: python

  from systole.hrv import nonlinear

  nonlinear(rr)

All the results have been tested against Kubios HVR 2.2 (<https://www.kubios.com>).
