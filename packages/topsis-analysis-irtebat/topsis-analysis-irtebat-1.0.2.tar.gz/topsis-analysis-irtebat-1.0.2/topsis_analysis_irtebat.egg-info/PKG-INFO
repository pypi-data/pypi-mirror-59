        ## About Topsis
        
        The Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is a multi-criteria decision analysis method, which was originally developed by Ching-Lai Hwang and Yoon in 1981 with further developments by Yoon in 1987, and Hwang, Lai and Liu in 1993. TOPSIS is based on the concept that the chosen alternative should have the shortest geometric distance from the positive ideal solution (PIS) and the longest geometric distance from the negative ideal solution (NIS).
        
        ## Installation
        
        Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install topsis-Irtebat.
        
        ```bash
        pip install topsis-analysis-irtebat
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        Following query on terminal will provide you the topsis analysis for input csv file.
        
        ```
        topsis -n "dataset-name.csv" -w "w1,w2,w3,w4,..." -i "i1,i2,i3,i4,..."
        
        ```
        
        w1,w2,w3,w4 represent weights, and i1,i2,i3,i4 represent impacts where 1 is used for maximize and 0 for minimize. 
        Size of w and i is equal to number of features. 
        
        Note that the first row and first column of dataset is dropped
        
        Rank 1 signifies best decision
