<a id="Improvements"></a><h2>Improvements and Refinements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Config files are now opened in universal newline mode. This means you
  can now edit config files for Webware running under one platform (e.g. Unix)
  with an editor running on a different platform (e.g. Windows) without
  causing any troubles.</li>
  <li>If a config file is expected, but could not be loaded, Webware will now
  print a warning to stdout explaining also the reason why the file was not
  loaded (e.g. wrong file permissions).</li>
</ul>
