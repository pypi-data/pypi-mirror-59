<p><% name %> version 1.2 released on 08/16/16</p>

<a id="Changes"></a><h2>Changes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The main change in the Webware for Python 1.2 release is that it
  requires at least Python version 2.6 or 2.7, while the Webware 1.1.x
  releases still support Python 2.4 and 2.5. By using the more modern Python
  features and idioms, the code has become a bit cleaner and leaner again,
  and  also a bit faster.</li>
  <li>Webware 1.2.x releases are still fully backward compatible and can
  serve as a good starting point for a modernization of the framework.
  Bringing the classic Webware API and plugin-system which predate Python 2
  in line with modern Python paradigms and conventions will need to break
  backward compatibility and to streamline the framework by removing some of
  the older and lesser used plugins and features which cannot be maintained
  any more. This and support for Python 3 is planned for later releases.</li>
</ul>
