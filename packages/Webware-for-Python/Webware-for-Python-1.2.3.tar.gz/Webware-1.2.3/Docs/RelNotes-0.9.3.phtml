<p><% name %> version 0.9.3 released on 04/26/07</p>

<ul>
  <li>This release of Webware for Python includes a couple of fixes and
  improvements of WebKit and some cleanup of the overall Webware codebase.
  Please have a look at the <a href="../WebKit/Docs/index.html">WebKit</a>
  release notes for details.</li>
  <li>An interesting new feature is automatic redirection to custom error pages
  whenever an HTTP error or any other Python exception occurs in a servlet.</li>
  <li>There still had been some quirks with Python versions before 2.2 and
  after 2.4, which have been solved in this release. Webware now runs fine
  with the current Python 2.5, but is still backward compatible down to
  Python 2.0 (except for KidKit, because Kid requires Python 2.3 anyway).
  The plan is to keep this broad compatibility range in the upcoming Webare
  1.0 release, postponing major refactoring and strengthening requirements
  until later versions.</li>
  <li>The <code>checksrc.py</code> tool has been improved a lot, and an
  <code>rcfile</code> for <code>pylint</code> has been added in order to
  enforce sticking to the <a href="StyleGuidelines.html">Webware Style
  Guidelines</a>, which have not been followed very strictly in the past.</li>
  <li>Note that you will need to recreate your working directories if you
  have been using a Webware version older than version 0.9.</li>
</ul>
