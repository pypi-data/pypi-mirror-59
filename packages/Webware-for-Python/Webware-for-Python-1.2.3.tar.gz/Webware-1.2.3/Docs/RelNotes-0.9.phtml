<p><% name %> version 0.9 released on 11/13/05</p>

<a id="Introduction"></a><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>It has taken much longer than usual to finish this release.
There have been so many improvements and changes that we cannot list them all.
Have a look at the <a href="../WebKit/Docs/RelNotes-0.9.html">WebKit release
notes</a> for some of the major changes in WebKit, the main Webware plug-in.</p>

<p>Note that Webware for Python has a new homepage at
<a href="http://www.webwareforpython.org">www.webwareforpython.org</a>
or short <a href="http://www.w4py.org">www.w4py.org</a>, and a new
Wiki at <a href="http://wiki.w4py.org">wiki.w4py.org</a>. Development
has moved from the CVS repository at SourceForge to a SVN repository
at <a href="http://svn.w4py.org">svn.w4py.org</a>. The old Wiki articles
and the CVS repository have been taken over to the new locations.</p>

<a id="NewFeatures"></a><h2>New Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Webware now contains a new "KidKit" plug-in that allows
  you to use "Kid" templates with Webware as an alternative to
  PSP templates. PSP is still supported as a part of Webware. Note that
  Kid itself is not part of Webware; you must install it separately.
  See the <a href="http://kid.lesscode.org">Kid homepage</a> and the
  <a href="../KidKit/Docs/RelNotes-0.9.html">KidKit release notes</a>.</li>
</ul>

<a id="Improvements"></a><h2>Improvements and Refinements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The documentation and doc processing has been improved.
  Instead of <span class="filename">RawToHTML.py</span> and the
  <code>raw</code> HTML format, the Webware "DocSupport" now provides
  a template engine <span class="filename">pytp.py</span> that
  processes <code>phtml</code> files with tags similar to PSP templates,
  for instance for including a header and a footer to the doc pages. The
  <code>htmlf</code> html fragments have been replaced by <code>phtml</code>, too.
  "DocSupport" also provides a new <span class="filename">autotoc.py</span>
  module for automatically creating a table of contents.
  In addition to the colorized source code and the summary page,
  the installer now also creates pydoc html page. The installer also
  creates default contexts for browsing the Docs via WebKit.</li>
  <li>The <span class="filename">install.py</span> has been improved.
  It creates a log file <span class="filename">install.log</span> now.</li>
  <li>Static and dynamic HTML pages have been changed to use cleaner HTML
  code and CSS instead of deprecated markup.</li>
  <li>The <span class="filename">MakeAppWorkDir.py</span> script has
  been rewritten to support new features of the launch script.</li>
</ul>
