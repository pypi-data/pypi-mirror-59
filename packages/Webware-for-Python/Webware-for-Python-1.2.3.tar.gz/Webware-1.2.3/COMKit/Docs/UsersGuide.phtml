<a id="Synopsis"></a><h2>Synopsis</h2>

<p>COMKit allows Microsoft Windows users to use COM objects inside of their WebKit servlets.</p>


<a id="Feedback"></a><h2>Feedback</h2>

<p>You can e-mail <a href="mailto:webware-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net">webware-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net</a> to give feedback, discuss features and get help using COMKit.</p>


<a id="Overview"></a><h2>Overview</h2>

<p>If you try to use the win32com module within your WebKit servlets without using this plug-in, you will encounter COM errors
due to the fact that each thread used with COM needs to be initialized properly for COM usage.  This plug-in provides the
proper initialization of each WebKit thread to allow COM to work properly.</p>

<p>When this plug-in is enabled, it configures COM in free-threading mode when used in conjunction with ThreadedAppServer.
If you've never used COM before, or if you'd like to learn what "free-threading mode" means, you should get a copy of the fine book
Python Programming on Win32 by Mark Hammond and Andy Robinson and pay special attention to the chapters about COM and also Appendix D
for details on COM threading models.</p>


<a id="Usage"></a><h2>Usage</h2>

<p>To use COM, simply set EnableCOM to True in your AppServer.config file.  This causes the app server threads to be configured properly for
COM free-threading.  Then go ahead and use win32com inside your servlets.</p>

<p>There's a simple example servlet that uses ADO for database access in ADOSample.py in the COMKit/Examples directory.</p>
