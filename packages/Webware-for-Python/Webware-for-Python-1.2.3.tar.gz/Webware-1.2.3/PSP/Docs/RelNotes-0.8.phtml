<a id="ReleaseNotes"></a><h2>Release Notes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Fixed a race condition that caused problems when multiple simultaneuos
  requests were made for a PSP that hadn't yet been imported.</li>
  <li>PSP no longer sets the tempfile.tempdir module level variable (which
  affects tempfile.mktemp()).</li>
  <li>The PSPReader module has been removed and replaced by the StreamReader.
  StreamReader has been in use for some time, the presesnce of PSPReader
  was misleading.</li>
  <li>Fixed the code generator to escape bacslash in addition to quotes
  previously escaped. This fixes the problem where escapes in PSP source
  would be interpreted by python as escapes, resulting in the HTML being
  generated with the result of the escapes. I.e.: \n in PSP previously
  resulted in an embedded newline rather than the text \n. This had broken
  the use of such escapes in embedded JavaScript.</li>
</ul>
