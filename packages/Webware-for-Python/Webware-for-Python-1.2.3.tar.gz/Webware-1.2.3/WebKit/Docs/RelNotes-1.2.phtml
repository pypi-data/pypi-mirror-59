<p><% name %> version 1.2 released on 08/16/16</p>

<a id="Changes"></a><h2>Changes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Webware now uses HTML 5 instead of HTML 4.1 by default.
  You can change this in your applications by overwriting the
  <code>Page.writeDocType()</code> method.</li>
</ul>

<a id="NewFeatures"></a><h2>New Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A new session store class <code>SessionRedisStore</code>
  has been added which uses Redis through the redis-py Python interface.
  Similar to the <code>SessionMemcachedStore</code>, this is very useful
  if you want to share Webware sessions between different app server
  instances. You can activate and configure the new class in
  <span class="filename">Application.config</span> by setting
  <code>SessionStore = 'Redis'</code>. The WebKit Configuration Guide
  explains the specific settings in detail.</li>
</ul>

<a id="Bugfixes"></a><h2>Bugfixes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The PSP handler of the ModPythonAdapter has been fixed.</li>
</ul>

<a id="DecommissionedAdapters"></a><h2>Decommissioned Adapters</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The LRWPAdapter which could be used to connect to the Xitami web server
  has been removed from Webware for Python. The latest version X5 of this web
  server is from 2009 and doesn't support LRWP anyway.</li>
  <li>The WASD CGIplus adapter has been removed from Webware for Python
  because it was unmaintained since 2009 and the website for this solution
  doesn't exist any more.</li>
  <li>The ModSnakeAdapter has been removed from Webware for Python since
  the mod_snake project terminated in 2002.</li>
  <li>AOLServer had been supported through the external PyWX project. Since
  the project has not been updated since 2002 and AOLServer is now NaviServer
  again, we do not refer to PyWX any more.</li>
</ul>
