WebKit app server start scripts for various flavors of Unix
-----------------------------------------------------------

The folder SysV contains start scripts for System V.

There is one generic start script for the WebKit application server that will
run with most Unix versions, and some start scripts supporting various flavors
of Unix and their features and peculiarities specifically.
Note that these scripts also serve as kill scripts for stopping the app server.

Refer to the documentation of your Unix version for instructions how to install
such start scripts on your system. For instance, on SUSE Linux, you would copy
the start script to /etc/init.d and enable it with the insserv command. Other
Unix systems may use a different folder for start scripts or you will have to
set symbolic links manually to enable the script.

You may choose the start script of the Unix flavor that is most similar to your
Unix system or use the generic script. The Webware install script will try to
copy an appropriate script under the name "webkit" to the Webware/WebKit folder.

If instead of copying the script, you will only make a symbolic link from the
system folder for start scripts to the script in the WebKit working directory,
the start script will take the location of the working directory and other
configuration parameters from the link, so you don't have to set these manually.

The folder systemd contains a unit file that can be used to start and stop
the WebKit application server using systemd.

The usual way to install it is to copy it to /etc/systemd/system and then run
"systemctl daemon-reload". You need to adapt the WORK_DIR environment variable
in the file. You may also want to change the user and group for running the
application server by changing the -u and -g options for Launch.py in the file.

Windows user should use the AppServerService script instead.
