Webware/WebKit/Sessions/

This directory will contain one file per session, if WebKit is configured to store sessions in files (via the ../Configs/Application.config setting SessionStore). Each file will be named after the session id with a ".ses" extension. You can choose a different location for this directory by changing the SessionStoreDir setting in ../Configs/Application.config.

See ../Docs/UsersGuide.html and ../Docs/Configuration.html for more information.
