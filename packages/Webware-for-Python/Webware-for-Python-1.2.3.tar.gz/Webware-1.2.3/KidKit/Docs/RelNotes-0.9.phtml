<a id="Introduction"></a><h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A first version of KidKit has been created by Winston Wolff in January 2005.</li>
  <li>This is the second version of KidKit created by Christoph Zwerschke in October 2005.</li>
  <li>These release notes describe the new features that have been added to the first version.</li>
</ul>

<a id="NewFeatures"></a><h2>New Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>KidKit now supports caching of compiled Kid templates in two different modes.
  You can either let Kid handle the caching; in that case the compiled modules are
  stored along with the Kid templates. Or you can let KidKit handle the caching; in this
  case it uses the directory <span class="filename">Cache/KidKit</span> to store
  compiled modules, optionally along with the corresponding source files.</li>
  <li>You can select a base class for the servlet that handles the Kid template.
  You can also select the method that is replaced in order to write the output.
  The default for this &quot;hook&quot; is <code>WebKit.Page.respond</code>.</li>
  <li>You can also select the output method that is used by Kid to serialize the template.</li>
</ul>

<a id="Improvements"></a><h2>Improvements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The Users's Guide and the KidKitExamples context have been amended a lot.</li>
</ul>

<a id="Changes"></a><h2>Changes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Only one variable <code>servlet</code> is passed to the template.
  The <code>fields</code> dictionary has to be derived as
  <code>servlet.request().fields()</code>.</li>
  <li>The Kid servlet factory is now based on the PSP servlet factory and uses
  the caching mechanisms of Webware. The old version was based on a Cheetah
  servlet factory that did not cache servlet classes and instances.</li>
</ul>
