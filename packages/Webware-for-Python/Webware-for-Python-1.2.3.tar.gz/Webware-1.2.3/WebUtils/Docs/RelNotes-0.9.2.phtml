<p><% name %> version 0.9.2 released on 09/18/06</p>

<a id="Improvements"></a><h2>Improvements and Refinements</h2>
<ul>
  <li><code>urlDecode()</code> and <code>urlEncode()</code> in
  <code>WebUtils.Funcs</code> now use the same implementation as
  <code>quote_plus()</code> and <code>unquote_plus()</code> in
  <code>urllib</code> of Python 2.4, which is faster than in older
  Python and Webware versions. This also means that <code>urlDecode()</code>
  now silently ignores erroneous encoding (as had been suggested
  by Ben Parker), including codes with only one digit.</li>
</ul>
