# Lavender

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/lavender.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lavender)

A slightly more compromising Python code formatter, based on the latest stable release of
[Black](https://github.com/python/black) (`19.10b0` at the time of writing).

## Differences from Black

- The default line length is 99 instead of 88 (configurable with `--line-length`).
- Single quoted strings are preferred (configurable with
 `--string-normalization none/single/double`).
- Empty lines between `class`es and `def`s are treated no differently from other code. The old
  behavior, which sometimes inserts double empty lines between them, remains available via
  `--special-case-def-empty-lines`.
- The Vim plugin configuration variable for line length is named `g:lavender_line_length` instead
  of `g:lavender_linelength`, for consistency with the other configuration variable names.

head.
