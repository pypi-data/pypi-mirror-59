This repository provides a easy way to access data from StudentVue portals in Python programs.

Note:

If this library isn't updating properly, try explictly installing the latest version (e.g. `pip3 install studentvue==1.3.0`).

If you're getting an [AttributeError](https://github.com/kajchang/StudentVue/issues/12) when trying to log in, this might mean that your school is on an older version of StudentVue. Try uninstalling this library (`pip uninstall studentvue`) and installing `studentvue-old` (`pip install studentvue-old`).

`studentvue-old` is not maintained and has a different API, but there is some [minimal documentation](https://github.com/kajchang/StudentVue/tree/old-version).

## Logging In

`pip install studentvue` or clone / download the repository and `python setup.py install`.

```python
from studentvue import StudentVue
sv = StudentVue('username', 'password', 'domain name') 
```

## Documentation

You can read some basic docs [here](https://kajchang.github.io/StudentVue/StudentVue.html).
