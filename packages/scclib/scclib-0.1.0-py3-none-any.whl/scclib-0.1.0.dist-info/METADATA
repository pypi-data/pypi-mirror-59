This mainly consists of:

- `scclib/device.py` the superclass from which all client computer handlers should inherit. It defines the three main methods that need to be implemented.
- `scclib/device_test.py` the test file to test an implemented device script with.
- `device_manual.md` the manual for writing configuration files for devices
- `LICENSE.md` the license with which this library complies
