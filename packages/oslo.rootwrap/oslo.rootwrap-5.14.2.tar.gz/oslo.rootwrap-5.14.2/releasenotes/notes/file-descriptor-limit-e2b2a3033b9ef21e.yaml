features:
  - |
    A configurable limit on the number of file descriptors that can be opened
    by a rootwrap-started process has been added. It defaults to disabled, but
    can be adjusted by setting the ``rlimit_nofile`` option in rootwrap.conf
    to a larger or smaller value.
upgrade:
  - |
    For OpenStack Rocky and older, the functionality is disabled by default.
    Users affected by the original issue and would like to make use of it
    can optionally enable it by setting the ``rlimit_nofile`` option in
    rootwrap.conf to a value of 1024 or higher.
