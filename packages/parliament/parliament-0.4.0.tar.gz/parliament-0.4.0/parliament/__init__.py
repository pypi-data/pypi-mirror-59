def is_arn_match(resource_type, arn_format, resource):
    """
    Match the arn_format specified in the docs, with the resource
    given in the IAM policy.  These can each be strings with globbing. For example, we
    want to match the following two strings:
    - arn:*:s3:::*/*
    - arn:aws:s3:::*personalize*

    That should return true because you could have "arn:aws:s3:::personalize/" which matches both.

    Input:
    - resource_type: Example "bucket", this is only used to identify special cases.
    - arn_format: ARN regex from the docs
    - resource: ARN regex from IAM policy

    Notes:

    This problem is known as finding the intersection of two regexes.
    There is a library for this here https://github.com/qntm/greenery but it is far too slow,
    taking over two minutes for that example before I killed the process.
    The problem can be simplified because we only care about globbed strings, not full regexes,
    but there are no Python libraries, but here is one in Go: https://github.com/Pathgather/glob-intersection

    We can cheat some because after the first sections of the arn match, meaning until the 5th colon (with some
    rules there to allow empty or asterisk sections), we only need to match the ID part.
    So the above is simplified to "*/*" and "*personalize*".

    Let's look at some examples and if these should be marked as a match:
    "*/*" and "*personalize*" -> True
    "*", "mybucket" -> True
    "mybucket", "*" -> True
    "*/*", "mybucket" -> False
    "*/*", "mybucket*" -> True
    "*mybucket", "*myotherthing" -> False
