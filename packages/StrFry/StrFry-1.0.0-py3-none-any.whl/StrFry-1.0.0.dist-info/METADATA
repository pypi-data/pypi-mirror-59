# StrFry - The easiest way to create human-readable tables in Python!



## Overview
Strfry makes data easier to read by organizing it into table form.

### What is a table?
A table is simply a iterable of one or more iterable. Lists are recommended, as some functions and methods may not work on immutables data types.

## Classes:

	- align()

## Functions:

	- normalize()
	- flip()

### ...More being added!

## Getting started

To download StrFry, either fork this github repo or simply use PyPi via pip.
```sh
$ pip install strfry
```
