Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        The `ox\_mon <https://github.com/emin63/ox_mon>`__ package provides some
        tools to keep monitor your machine to keep it up to date, free of
        viruses, and generally working properly.
        
        Basically, there are lots of little monitoring and checking tasks you
        may find yourself needing to do. You could write a separate script for
        each such task, but it would be nice to have some basic scaffolding for
        things like notifications, logging, testing, and so on to simplify
        machine monitoring. Better yet, by having a common framework many
        developers can contribute small snippets of such tools that work in a
        similar way to simplify life for everyone.
        
        Once you install ``ox_mon`` as described in the
        `Installation <id:sec-installation>`__ section, you can do something
        like
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            ox_mon check <thing> [<OPTIONS]
        
        to run various checks discussed in the `Checkers <id:sec-checkers>`__
        section with a consistent reporting system described in the
        `Notifiers <id:sec-notifiers>`__ section.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        You can install via the usual ``pip install ox_mon``. If you want to
        install and be able to edit your installation, you may consider doing
        something like ``pip install --editable ox_mon``.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        You can see the list of possible commands via
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            ox_mon --help
        
        Checkers
        --------
        
        One of the most useful commands is ``ox_mon check``. If you try
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            ox_mon check --help
        
        you will see a list of possible checkers you can run. These all use the
        same general syntax for things like how to notify an administrator if
        issues are found while also checker specific customization.
        
        Checker: apt
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The ``apt`` checker will check your Ubuntu installation to see if you
        have the latest security updates installed. If you do, then nothing
        happens. If you have not done ``apt update`` recently or you do **NOT**
        have the latest security packages installed, then you will be notified.
        
        You can control the notification methods and how many days have passed
        since you did ``apt update`` using command line options. For example,
        doing
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            ox_mon check apt --notifier echo --age-in-days 7
        
        would not notify you provided that you have done ``apt update`` within 7
        days. If your packages are stale, the notification will just print a
        message. See the `Notifiers section <id:sec-notifiers>`__ for
        notification options.
        
        Checker: disk
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The ``disk`` checker will check your system to see if the disk is too
        full. If so, you will be notified as described in the
        `Notifiers <id:sec-notifiers>`__ section.
        
        You can control the notification methods and how full the disk is
        allowed to be before it triggers an alarm. For example, doing
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            ox_mon check disk --notifier loginfo --max-used-pct 5
        
        would not notify you using python's ``logging.INFO`` stream (which
        usually goes to ``stderr``) if your disk is more than ``5%`` full.
        
        Checker: anti-virus
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The ``clamscan`` checker will use `ClamAV <https://www.clamav.net/>`__
        (assuming you have it installed) to virus scan your system. You can
        control the target location to scan via something like
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            ox_mon check clamscan --target $HOME
        
        Notifiers
        ---------
        
        There are a variety of ways to get notifications:
        
        -  ``echo``: Just echoes notification to stdout.
        -  ``email``: Will send you an email provided you specify the following:
        
           -  ``OX_MON_EMAIL_TO``: A comma separated list of email addresses
              (e.g., ``foo@exmaple.com`` or ``foo@exmaple.com,bar@example.com``)
              to send email to. If not set, will attempt to lookup from
              environment variable.
           -  ``OX_MON_EMAIL_FROM``: Sending email address. If not set, will
              attempt to lookup from environment variable.
           -  ``OX_MON_GMAIL_PASSWD``: A password to use if you want to use
              gmail as the SMTP relay to send mail from. This password should
              correspond to the username in ``OX_MON_EMAIL_FROM``.
           -  ``OX_MON_SES_PROFILE``: If provided and email notifier is
              requested, will use this to send email via AWS SES. If not set,
              will attempt lookup from environment.
           -  **IMPORTANT**: Either ``OX_MON_SES_PROFILE`` or
              ``OX_MON_GMAIL_PASSWD`` is required to send emails.
        
        -  ``loginfo``: Will use Python's ``logging.info`` to send notification.
           This can be useful if you do not want the notifications in stdout but
           in stderr.
