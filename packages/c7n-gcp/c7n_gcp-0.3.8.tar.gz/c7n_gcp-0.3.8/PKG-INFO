        By default custodian will use credentials associated to the gcloud cli, which will generate
        warnings per google.auth (https://github.com/googleapis/google-auth-library-python/issues/292)
        
        The recommended authentication form for production usage is to create a service account and
        credentials, which will be picked up via by the custodian cli via setting the
        *GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS* environment variable.
        
        
        # Serverless
        
        Custodian supports both periodic and api call events for serverless policy execution.
