Description: # CodeChecker
        
        ## Use Case
        
        Runs a file designated _master.['py', '.java', '.cpp'] to generate a master output that can test the output of the other files in the directory. This can be used for fast comparisons for grading
        
        ## Usage
        
        in terminal
        
        ```bash
        
        <python3> <path>_codeChecker.py
        ```
        
        or paste _codeChecker into the directory and run it locally
        
        ## The Output
        
        Generated .csv file that will contain filename, output, expected output, matching conditions
        
        ## Language Information
        
        ### Python
        
        Runs on the cpython compiler, has access to your PyPI packages if needed tests multiple commands ie ['python', 'python3', 'py', 'py3']. If .pyc files are generated they are also deleted
        
        ### Java
        
        Runs on the jvm compiler over 2 commands first generating the .class files then running them to compare outputs on the standard javac and java commands. At the end the .class files are removed
        
        ### C++
        
        Coming soon hopefully on the gcc compiler, I need to check how that works with Windows
