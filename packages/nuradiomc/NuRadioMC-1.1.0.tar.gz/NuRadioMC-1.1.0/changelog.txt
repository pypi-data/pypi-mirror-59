version 1.0.1 - ????/??/??

new features:
- specifying the bandwidth of the detector is no longer required. Now, the bandwidth is calculated automatically from the
  detector_simulation that the user defines by examining the NuRadioReco modules that alter the bandwidth (i.e. bandpass filters
  and hardware respone incoroprator) using the new module registry feature of NuRadioReco. The noise RMS is then calculated
  from the noise temperature and the bandwidth of the detector.
  Alternatively, the user can specify the RMS noise value manually which is useful to simulate an existing detector where
  the noise RMS is known.
- production includes testing of NuRadioReco files
- NuRadioMC simulations with noise and at Moore's Bay site are tested in our CI test suite
- Event generation using PROPOSAL lepton propagation available
- fft and units utilities are removed. These should be taken from NuRadioReco from now on.
  IMPORTANT: Note that in the fft the frequency spectrum is now given per frequency instead of per bin

bugfixes:
	- fixed that Veff utility script didn't calculate effective volumes for individual triggers
	- fixed that the multiple_triggers key was not created for multiple stations
	- Angular distribution now accounts for projected area

version 1.0.0 - 2019/08/30 - first python 3 release
