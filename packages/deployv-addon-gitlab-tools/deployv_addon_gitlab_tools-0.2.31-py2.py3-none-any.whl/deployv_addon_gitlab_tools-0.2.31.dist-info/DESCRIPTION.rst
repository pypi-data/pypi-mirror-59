Deployv addon: Gitlab tools. Generated by cookiecutter and cookiecutter-deploy-addon.

A small set of tools to automate repetitive tasks for testing gitlab repositories.

It is important to say that this is not by any mean a replacement for the MQT tools, these are tools that we need in order to make gitlab-ci work properly with the MQT tools.
