## Scheduled thread executor
Inspired by great work of Doug Lea

Main ideas: working without thread sleep and minimum concurrency over-waiting

## Scheduled tasks are important part of any production project from smallest to biggest
If you have any ideas how make that code more stable and more robustness, welcome.

Of course you could fork and inject new ideas in you owned code.
