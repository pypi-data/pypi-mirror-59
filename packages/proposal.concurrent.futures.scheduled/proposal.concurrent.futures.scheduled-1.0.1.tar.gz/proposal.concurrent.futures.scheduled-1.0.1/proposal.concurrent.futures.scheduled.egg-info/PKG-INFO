Description: ## Scheduled thread executor
        Inspired by great work of Doug Lea
        
        Main ideas: working without thread sleep and minimum concurrency over-waiting
        
        ## Scheduled tasks are important part of any production project from smallest to biggest
        If you have any ideas how make that code more stable and more robustness, welcome.
        
        Of course you could fork and inject new ideas in you owned code.
