Fork this repository.\n2. Setup a virtual environment for development using `poetry`: `poetry install`.\n3. Create a branch: `git checkout -b <branch_name>`.\n4. Make your changes and commit them `git commit -m '<commit_message>'`.\n5. Push to the original branch: `git push origin <project_name>/<location>`.\n6. Create the pull request.\n\nPlease note that we require you to meet the following criteria:\n- Write unit tests for your code.\n- Run linting with `flake8` and `pylint`\n- Run type checking using `mypy`\n- Format your code according to the `black` code style\n\nTo ease the execution of the tools, we provide a `Makefile` with various targets.\nThe easiest way to execute all checks is to run `make check` on a `poetry shell`.\nPush your commits only if they pass all checks!\nThese tools are also executed in continuous integration on TravisCI and will also\n check you pull request.\nFailing a check will block your pull request from being merged!\n\n## Contributors\n\nSee the [Contributors page](https://github.com/pytesting/test-runner/graphs/contributors)\nfor a list of contributors.\nThanks to all contributors!\n\n\n## License\n\n`test-runner` is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\n`test-runner` is distributed in the hope that it will be useful\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANT; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
