        Purpose
        =======
        
        This is a Plone addon which allows to manage redirects.
        It allows to add new redirects which may point to internal
        or external URLs.
        
        
        Compatibility
        =============
        
        Supports Plone `4.3` and `5.1`.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Add the package as dependency to your setup.py:
        
        .. code:: python
        
          setup(...
                install_requires=[
                  ...
                  'ftw.redirector',
                ])
        
        or to your buildout configuration:
        
        .. code:: ini
        
          [instance]
          eggs += ftw.redirector
        
        and rerun buildout.
        
        After restarting your Plone, install ftw.redirector through the Plone addons
        control panel, quickinstaller or portal_setup.
        
        After installing the addon, go to the Plone control panel for redirects in
        order to add new redirects.
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        After successfully installing the addon, go to the Plone control panel,
        where a new "Redirect Configuration" link is added:
        
        .. image:: https://raw.github.com/4teamwork/ftw.redirector/master/docs/controlpanel.png
        
        Redirect rules can easily be managed by editing the configuration:

        How it works
        ============
        
        - The redirect config is a dexterity object (mainly for ``ftw.publisher`` compatibility).
        - Redirects are only applied if no content is found (404).
        - Redirect rules are applied top-down: top roles have higherpriority.
          The first matching rule is applied, later rules arenot considered.
        - Redirects match when the request path starts with thesource path.
        - Each rule requires a source path and a destination.
        - The source path must start with a slash and should not be the site root.
        - The destination may be a path (starting with a slash) or an URL to an external site.
