# Hierarchical MCRLLM (3 steps)
# 
# MCR takes an input X spectral matrix to obtain:
# C : composition map or n components
# S : spectra of the n components
#
# STEP 1. 
# Call raw X data and repeatedly it subdivided it into n=2
# components. This generates multiple spectra (S=2 for each)
# subdivision.
#
# STEP 2.
# PCA on the multiple spectra to manually identify the
# reference spectra (i.e. pure species)
#
# STEP 3.
# Use the reference spectra (step 2) in an incomplete 
# application of MCRLLM in which the reference spectra are
# not evaluted anew.
