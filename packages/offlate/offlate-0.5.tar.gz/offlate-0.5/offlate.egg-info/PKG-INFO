Description: Offlate is a graphical interface designed for translators
        of free and open source software.  Software projects in the free software community
        use a wide range of online platforms (or no platform at all) to manage their
        translations.  Offlate is able to connect to many different platforms, copy the
        translations locally, and let you work on them on your computer, offline and in
        a unified interface.
