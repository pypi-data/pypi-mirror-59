Description: # mlstream
        
        Machine learning for streamflow prediction.
        
        Oxford English Dictionary:
        
        >  *maelstrom*, n. &nbsp;  /ˈmeɪlˌstrɑm/
        >
        > 1. A powerful whirlpool, originally (usually Maelstrom) one in the Arctic Ocean off the west coast of Norway, which was formerly supposed to suck in and destroy all vessels within a wide radius.
        > 2. Any state of turbulence or confusion; a swirling mass of small objects.
        
        ## Usage
        
        This project is still work in progress.
        The idea is to create an easy way of training machine learning streamflow models:
        Just provide your data, select a model (or provide your own), and get the predictions.
        
        ### Training
        ```python
        exp = Experiment(data_path, is_train=True, run_dir=run_dir,
                         start_date='01012000', end_date='31122015',
                         basins=train_basin_ids, 
                         forcing_attributes=['precip', 'tmax', 'tmin'],
                         static_attributes=['area', 'regulation'])
        
        exp.set_model(model)
        exp.train()
        ```
        
        ### Inference
        ```python
        run_dir = Path('./experiments')
        exp = Experiment(data_path, is_train=False, 
                         run_dir=run_dir, 
                         basins=test_basin_ids,
                         start_date='01012016', end_date='31122018')
        model.load(run_dir / 'model.pkl')
        exp.set_model(model)  
        results = exp.predict()
        ```
