        ploneconf2016.policy
        ====================
        
        Developed for use on Plone Conference sites.
        
        Installs add-ons needed for the site, primarily:
        
        - easyform
        - Mosaic
        - social networking sharing
        
        Defines Dexterity content types for:
        
        - presentations
        - speakers
