Description: Cyckei
        ======
        
        Details about Cyckei can be found in our `documentation`_.
        
        Cyckei is a battery cycling application designed to carry out charging, discharging, and data collection on lithium-ion cells. It is designed to interface with the Keithley 2602A/B SourceMeter for calorimetry testing, but can be used in a variety or setups.
        
        The application uses a Python-like scripting format in order to write cycles that are carried out on cells. To learn more about scripts, read the Creating Scripts section in our `documentation`_ or look at the example below.
        
        ::
        
            for i in range(3):
              AdvanceCycle()
              CCCharge(0.1, reports=(("voltage", 0.01), ("time", ":5:")), ends=(("voltage", ">", 4.2), ("time", ">", "4::")))
              CCDischarge(0.1, reports=(("voltage", 0.01), ("time", ":5:")), ends=(("voltage", "<", 3.0), ("time", ">", "4::")))
              Rest(reports=(("time", "::1"),), ends=(("time", ">", "::15"),))
        
        Cyckei is open source, and we encourage users to modify the code to fit a given setup. Details on contributing to the project are in the Contributing of our `documentation`_.
        
        Cyckei is currently developed and maintained by Gabriel Ewig and Vincent Chevrier at Cyclikal, LLC. For more information about Cyclikal, visit `cyclikal.com`_.
