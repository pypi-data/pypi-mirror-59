This package aims to provide a simple to use command line interface for the `MythX <https://mythx.io/>`_ smart contract
security analysis API. It's main purpose is to demonstrate how advanced features can be implemented using the
`PythX <https://github.com/dmuhs/pythx/>`_ Python language bindings for MythX to simplify API interaction.


What is MythX?
--------------

MythX is a security analysis API that allows anyone to create purpose-built security tools for smart
