Installing Sycomore
===================

Packaged
--------

Packaged versions of Sycomore are available on `pypi`_ and `Anaconda`_ for Linux, macOS and Windows. The following table summarizes the availability of packages according to the version of the Python interpreter.

+------------------+---------------+--------------------+
| Operating system | conda-forge   | PyPI               |
+==================+===============+====================+
| Linux            | 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 | 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 |
+------------------+---------------+--------------------+
| macOS (≥ 9)      | 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 | 3.6, 3.7, 3.8      |
+------------------+---------------+--------------------+
| Windows          | 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 | 3.5, 3.6, 3.7      |
+------------------+---------------+--------------------+

To install from `Anaconda`_, type ``conda install -c conda-forge sycomore``. To install from `pypi`_, type ``pip3 install sycomore`` (or ``pip install sycomore``). If you are installing from `pypi`_ and no pre-compiled version is available for your platform, pip will try to install from the source archive; in that case you will need a C++11 compiler, `CMake`_ and `pybind11`_ to successfully build Sycomore.

As of November 2019, compatibility with Python 2 is still possible: however due to the `end of life of Python 2`_, ensuring this compatibility is not a goal of Sycomore, and no such package is distributed.

From source
-----------

Installing Sycomore from source requires a C++11 compiler, Python (≥ 3.5) and `pybind11`_. To take full advantage of your CPU, `OpenMP`_ is strongly recommended. If you want to validate your build of Sycomore, you should run the unit tests, which require `Boost.Test`_. Sycomore uses `CMake`_, so the simplest way to build it would be to create a *build* directory inside the source directory, run *cmake*, then run *make*:

.. code-block:: shell
  
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make

In addition to the common CMake options (e.g. *CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE* or *CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX*), Sycomore may be built with the following options:

- *BUILD_SHARED_LIBS* controls the generation of static libraries or share libraries; defaults to *ON*, i.e. building shared libraries
- *BUILD_TESTING* controls the build of the C++ unit test executables; defaults to *ON*, i.e. the unit tests are compiled
- *BUILD_PYTHON_WRAPPERS* controls the build of the Python wrappers; defaults to *ON*, i.e. the Python wrappers are built
- *BUILD_STANDALONE_PYTHON_WRAPPERS*, controls whether a standalone Python library is built, wihtout any pure C++ compatibility; defaults to *OFF*, i.e. both the C++ and Python libraries are built
- *USE_OPENMP*, to compile with or without OpenMP support; defaults to *ON*, unless *BUILD_STANDALONE_PYTHON_WRAPPERS* is set to *ON*

The compilation can take advantage of a multi-core CPU either by using `make`_ with the *-jN* flag (where *N* is the number of concurrent tasks, i.e. the number of cores) or by using `Ninja`_. Once the compilation succeeds, the units tests can be run from the build directory:

.. code-block:: shell
  
  export SYCOMORE_TEST_DATA=$(pwd)/../tests/data
  ctest -T Test

This code benefits hugely from compiler optimizations. It is recommended to build a *Release* version and use extra compiler flags to speed-up the simulations. Moreover, using OpenMP on macOS requires additional flags. Details of these flags on Linux and macOS are provided in the next sections.

Debian
......

The following call to *apt-get* will install all dependencies:

.. code-block:: shell
  
  apt-get install -y cmake g++ libboost-dev libboost-test-dev python3-pybind11

When compiling with GCC on Debian 9 (stretch) and Debian 10 (buster), *-ffast-math* enables *-ffinite-math-only*, which breaks some parts of Sycomore (the application of a time interval with gradients or the computation of isochromat with off-resonance effects). All `other optimizations turned on by -ffast-math`_ can however be used and the recommended call to CMake is:

.. code-block:: shell
  
  cmake \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-march=native -fno-math-errno -funsafe-math-optimizations -fno-rounding-math -fno-signaling-nans -fcx-limited-range -fexcess-precision=fast -D__FAST_MATH__" \
    ..

For more details on floating point math with GCC, refer to the `official documentation`_.

macOS with Homebrew
...................

The following call to `brew` will install all dependencies:

.. code-block:: shell
  
  brew install boost cmake libomp pybind11

The documentation of the `-ffast-math option in Clang`_ is rather terse, but the `source code`_ provides more details. Despite disabling non-finite maths, using *-ffast-math* does not break Sycomore. With the extra flags required to detect OpenMP, the recommended call to CMake is:

.. code-block:: shell
  
  OpenMP_FLAGS="-Xpreprocessor -fopenmp -I/usr/local/include"
  cmake \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-march=native -ffast-math" \
    -DOpenMP_C_FLAGS="${OpenMP_FLAGS}" -DOpenMP_CXX_FLAGS="${OpenMP_FLAGS}" \
    -DOpenMP_C_LIB_NAMES="omp" -DOpenMP_CXX_LIB_NAMES="omp" \
    -DOpenMP_omp_LIBRARY=/usr/local/lib/libomp.dylib \
    ../
