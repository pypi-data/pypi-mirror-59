Regular (constant gradient moment) EPG
======================================

In the regular EPG model, the dephasing order is reduced to a unitless integer :math:`k\ge 0` which represents a multiplicative factor of some arbitrary basic dephasing. The implementation of regular EPG in Sycomore has two high-level operations: :meth:`Regular.apply_pulse` to simulate an RF hard pulse and :meth:`Regular.apply_time_interval` which simulates relaxation, diffusion and dephasing due to gradients. The lower-level EPG operators used by :meth:`Regular.apply_time_interval` are also accessible as :meth:`Regular.relaxation`, :meth:`Regular.diffusion` and :meth:`Regular.shift`. The states of the model are stored in :attr:`Regular.states`, and the fully-focused magnetization (i.e. :math:`\tilde{F}_0`) is stored in :attr:`Regular.echo`.

For simulations involving multiple gradient moments (all multiple of a given gradient moment), the "unit" gradient moment must be declared when creating the model; for simulations involving only a single gradient moment, this declaration is optional, but should be present nevertheless.

The following code sample simulates the evolution of the signal in an `RF- & gradient spoiled GRE`_ experiment.

.. code-block:: python
    
  import numpy
  import sycomore
  from sycomore.units import *

  species = sycomore.Species(1000*ms, 1000*ms)
  flip_angle=30*deg
  TE = 5*ms
  TR = 25*ms
  phase_step = 117*deg
  slice_thickness = 1*mm
  G_readout = 2*numpy.pi*rad / (sycomore.gamma*slice_thickness)

  model = sycomore.epg.Regular(species, unit_gradient_area=G_readout)
  repetitions = int((4*species.T1/TR))

  echo = numpy.zeros(repetitions, dtype=complex)
  for r in range(0, repetitions):
      phase = (phase_step * 1/2*(r+1)*r)

      model.apply_pulse(flip_angle, phase)
      model.apply_time_interval(TE)

      rewind = numpy.exp(-1j*phase.convert_to(rad))
      echo[r] = model.echo*rewind

      model.apply_time_interval(TR-TE, G_readout/(TR-TE))

Once the echo signal has been gathered for all repetitions, its magnitude and phase can be plotted using respectively `numpy.abs`_ and `numpy.angle`_.
