Description: # Bunqexport
        
        After the some discussion in the lexware Finanzmanger forum, it looks
        like the authors do not feel the need to integrate bunq into their
        application (https://forum.lexware.de/threads/37851/)
        
        Also in the bunq forums, no one seemed to have a prior solution
        (https://together.bunq.com/d/24026-lexware-quicken-finanzmanager-import-from-bunq).
        
        So I decided to implement a simple export with python and the bunq
        rest API.
        
        ## Features
        
        * Connect to bunq (https://www.bunq.com) API with a pregenerated API
          key (see Tinker example: https://github.com/bunq/tinker_python)
        * Export payments from bunq as `json` and `csv` into one file per
          account
        * support special `csv` format with timestamps in `DD.MM.YYYY` format
          in timstamps, as expected from `Haufe-Lexware Finanzmanger`, when
          mode is `lexware`
        * Unit testing using `nose`
        * Pre-commit checking with `pre-commit`
        
        ## Usage
        
        Install `bunqexport` and generate an export:
        
        ```
        $ pip install bunqexport
        $ bunqexport --conf bunq-production.conf --mode lexware
        [INFO   ] Using conf: bunq-production.conf
        [INFO   ] found XX while fetching last 200 Payments for account XXXXXXX
        [INFO   ] Wrote bunq_XXXXXXX_Default.csv
        [INFO   ] Wrote bunq_XXXXXXX_Default.json
