Description: ratio\_merge
        ============
        
        *A small utility function for merging two python lists by some ratio*
        
        This function acts as a generator producing elements from the two given
        lists by the given ``<merge_ratio>``. The generator would preserve any
        internal order within the lists and would produce no more then
        ``<desired_length>`` elements in total.
        
        In case the total number of elements withing either the lists is not
        enough to maintain the desired ratio throughout, the function would
        continue to generate elements from the remaining set until
        ``<desired_length>`` elements were produced.
        
        If the ``<strict>`` parameter is set to True the function will stop
        producing elements once one of the lists has ran out of elemets. It
        whould also bias the produced list to fit closest to the length of the
        ``<first_list>``.
