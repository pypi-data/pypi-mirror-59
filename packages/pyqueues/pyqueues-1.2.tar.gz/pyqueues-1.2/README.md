pyqueues
=================================

A library for Priority-Queues containing Indexed-Priority-Queue and Simple Priority-Queue.

--Installation:

clone the this reporitory using,
`https://github.com/abecus/Queue.git`

or, install using pip,
`pip install pyqueues`

Works with Python 3.x and PyPy.

## Overview
Both, the Indexed priority queue and the queue has been implemented as a min binary heap to use it as a max heap or to uea it with custome key pass the values as a tuple in the heaps eg. (key, value). The time complexities are,

- peek highest priority element: O(1) 

- pop highest priority element: O(log n) 

- push new element: O(log n) 

additionally for Indexed Priority Queue,

- lookup of any item by key: O(1)

- remove element by key: O(log n) 

- update element by key: O(log n) 

## Usage

		from pyqueues.indexedPriorityQueue import IndexedPriorityQueue
		from pyqueues.heap import heapify, heapPop, heapPush

- to heapify a list (does not changes the original list, but heapifies internally),

		arr = [10, 20, 15, 12, 40, 25, 18, 40]
		pq = IndexedPriorityQueue(arr)
		pq.heapify()

- to push items into the priority queue,	

		pq.push(2)
		pq.push(-1)
    	
- to update a item using key (we an saperatly keep track of the key of the values using a dict by mapping values to the arrSize arrtibute of the priority queue)
    	
		pq.update(pq.arrSize-1, 100)    # updates -1 to 100
		pq.update(pq.arrSize-2, -1)     # updates 2 to -1

"similarly use pq.decreaseKey() and pq.increaseKey() methods (works in half of, the time required for update method), when we know that we are increseing or decresing the values while updating."

- to remove a values from priority queue,

		pq.remove(pq.arrSize-1)    # removes 100

- to pop highest priority element,

		pq.pop()        # pops -1
