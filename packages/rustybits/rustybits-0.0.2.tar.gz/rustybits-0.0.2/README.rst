.. IMPORTANT::

  This package is still in the planning/pre-alpha phase.


Overview
========

The `RustyBits` application helps you archive files.

Specifically, with files that you don't really need anymore, that you
probably should just delete, but you don't want to because... "what
if". But organizing archived files is time consuming.

So instead, just move them into a RustyBits folder, it will prompt for
some keywords and automatically add some metadata, and you can forget
about them. Until you need them.


Installation
============

TL;DR::

  apt install python3-wxgtk4.0 libfuse-dev
  pip install rustybits


Usage
=====

TL;DR::

  rustybits mount ~/.var/lib/rustybits ~/Desktop/RustyBits
