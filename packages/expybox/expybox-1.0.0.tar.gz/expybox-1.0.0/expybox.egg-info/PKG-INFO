Description: # ExpyBox [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/expybox/badge/?version=latest)](https://expybox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)
        
        ExpyBox is a Jupyter notebook toolbox for model interpretability/explainability.
        It lets you create interactive Jupyter notebooks to explain your model.
        
        [Documentation](https://expybox.readthedocs.org)
        
        ## Usage
        This package is meant to be used inside of Jupyter notebook, other usage makes little to no sense.
        First you need to import and instantiate the ExpyBox class:
        
        ```python
        from expybox import ExpyBox
        expybox = ExpyBox(train_data, predict_function, kernel_globals=globals())
        ```
        
        Now you can use the supported interpretability methods like  this
        (for list of supported methods refer to the [documentation](https://expybox.readthedocs.org)):
        ```python
        expybox.lime()
        ```
        which creates a form:
        ![ExpyBox form example](docs/pictures/expybox-lime.png "ExpyBox-form")
        
        In this form you can set up explained instance (if it's necessary for the selected method)
        and method parameters. After clicking on `Run Interact` the method will be executed
        and its output will be shown below the form.
        
        You can then change the parameters or the explained instance and press `Run Interact` 
        again which will rerun the method with new parameters.
        
        You can find an example Jupyter notebook in `examples` folder. 
        
        ## Instalation
        Because of *alibi* package ExpyBox requires **64-bit** Python 3.7 or higher. 
        It is also recommended to create separate virtual enviroment - you can use Pythons 
        [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).
        
        Otherwise the installation process is the same as for other packages, just use pip:
        ```bash
        pip install expybox
        ```
