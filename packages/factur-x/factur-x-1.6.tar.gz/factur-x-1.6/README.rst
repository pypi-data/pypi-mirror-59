Factur-X Python library
=======================

Factur-X is the e-invoicing standard for France and Germany. The Factur-X specifications are available on the `FNFE-MPE website <http://fnfe-mpe.org/factur-x/>`_ in English and French. The Factur-X standard is also called ZUGFeRD 2.0 in Germany.

The main feature of this Python library is to generate Factur-X invoices from a regular PDF invoice and a Factur-X compliant XML file.

This lib provides additionnal features such as:

* extract the Factur-X XML file from a Factur-X PDF invoice,
* check a Factur-X XML file against the official XML Schema Definition.

Some of the features provided by this lib also work for ZUGFeRD 1.0 (the ancestor of the Factur-X standard).

Installation
============

This library works both on python 2.7 and python 3.

To install it for python 3, run:

.. code::

  sudo pip3 install --upgrade factur-x

To install it for python 2.7, run:

.. code::

  sudo pip install --upgrade factur-x

Usage
=====

.. code::

  from facturx import generate_facturx_from_file

  facturx_pdf_invoice = generate_facturx_from_file(regular_pdf_invoice, facturx_xml_file)


To have more examples, look at the source code of the command line tools located in the *bin* subdirectory.

Command line tools
==================

Several command line tools are provided with this lib:

* **facturx-pdfgen**: generate a Factur-X PDF invoice from a regular PDF invoice and an XML file
* **facturx-pdfextractxml**: extract the Factur-X XML file from a Factur-X PDF invoice
* **facturx-xmlcheck**: check a Factur-X XML file against the official Factur-X XML Schema Definition

All these commande line tools have a **-h** option that explains how to use them and shows all the available options.
