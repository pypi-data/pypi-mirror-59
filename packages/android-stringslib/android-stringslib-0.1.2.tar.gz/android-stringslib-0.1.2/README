Android Strings Lib
===================

Android Strings Lib provides support for android's strings.xml files.  These
files are used to translate strings in android apps.

Android Strings Lib is built for python 3.  Patches for adding python 2 support
are welcome, but may break at any point as I don't intend to test it.


Quick Start Guide
-----------------

```python
import androidstringslib
# The two arguments are the file with original strings (here, English) and the
# file containing the translations (here, French).
an = androidstringslib.android('app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml', 'app/src/main/res/values-fr/strings.xml', 'fr')
for entry in an:
        # Automatically translate 'Logcat' to itself
        if entry.orig == 'Logcat':
                entry.dst = 'Logcat'
# Save the result to the destination file
# Note that this also updated the destination file to the newer origin file.
an.save()
```
