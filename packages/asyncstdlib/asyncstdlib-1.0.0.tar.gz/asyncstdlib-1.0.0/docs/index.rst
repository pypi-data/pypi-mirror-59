   source/glossary

The ``asyncstdlib`` library re-implements functions and classes of the Python
standard library to make them compatible with ``async`` callables, iterables
and context managers.
It is fully agnostic to ``async`` event loops and seamlessly works with
:py:mod:`asyncio`, third-party libraries such as :py:mod:`trio`, as well as
any custom ``async`` event loop.

All re-implementations are located in submodules of :py:mod:`asyncstdlib`
with the same name as those of the Python standard library.
For simplicity, the :py:mod:`asyncstdlib` namespace also exposes all individual
functions and classes directly.
For example, :py:mod:`asyncstdlib.builtins.enumerate` is also available
as ``asyncstdlib.enumerate``.

Standard Library Modules
========================

:py:mod:`asyncstdlib.builtins`
    Replicates any :ref:`built-in-funcs` that take an :term:`iterable`,
    such as :py:func:`~asyncstdlib.builtins.zip`, :py:func:`~asyncstdlib.builtins.sum`
    or :py:func:`~asyncstdlib.builtins.list`.

:py:mod:`asyncstdlib.functools`
    Replicates any :py:mod:`functools` that take an :term:`iterable`,
    which is just :py:func:`~asyncstdlib.functools.reduce`
    and :py:func:`~asyncstdlib.functools.lru_cache`.

:py:mod:`asyncstdlib.contextlib`
    Replicates any :py:mod:`contextlib` objects working with an :term:`iterable`
    or :term:`context manager`,
    such as :py:func:`~asyncstdlib.contextlib.contextmanager` or
    :py:func:`~asyncstdlib.contextlib.closing`.

:py:mod:`asyncstdlib.itertools`
    Replicates any :py:mod:`itertools` that lazily take an :term:`iterable`,
    such as :py:func:`~asyncstdlib.itertools.cycle`,
    :py:func:`~asyncstdlib.itertools.chain`
    or :py:func:`~asyncstdlib.itertools.accumulate`.

Async Neutral Arguments
=======================

Many objects of :py:mod:`asyncstdlib` are :term:`async neutral` -- they accept
*both* regular and async arguments.
Type annotations use *(async)* to denote async neutral objects.
For example, the annotation *(int, ...) â†’ (async) bool* denotes a call that takes an
:py:class:`int` and either returns a boolean directly *or* requires ``await`` to
return a boolean.

Whether a call is regular or async is determined by inspecting its
return type at runtime.
This supports async-producing factories, such as an ``async def``
function wrapped in :py:class:`functools.partial`.
However, this also means that the result must consistently be *either*
regular or async.

Note that only *arguments* to :py:mod:`asyncstdlib` may be async neutral.
All callables of :py:mod:`asyncstdlib` consistently provide
:term:`awaitables <awaitable>` and
:term:`asynchronous iterators <asynchronous iterator>`.

Async Iterator Cleanup
======================

Cleanup of async iterables is special in that :py:meth:`~agen.aclose` may require
an active event loop. This is not given when garbage collection finalizes an
async iterable via its :py:meth:`~object.__del__` method. Thus, async iterators
should be cleaned up deterministically whenever possible (see `PEP 533`_ for details).

Whenever an async iterator of :py:mod:`asyncstdlib` creates a temporary
async iterator [#tempiter]_ during iteration, it assumes sole ownership of this iterator.
It guarantees to clean up such temporary async iterators as soon as
the :py:mod:`asyncstdlib` async iterator itself is cleaned up.

.. [#tempiter] An iterator ``aiter = a.iter(source)`` is assumed to be temporary if
         it is a new object, that is ``aiter is not source`` holds true.
