        Welcome to the Project Scope management tool
        
        This tool is created to help manage the semantic connections in a project. The idea
        is that there are many kinds of data required by a project, and sometimes the organization
        of ideas cannot be effectively conveyed with a hierarchical file system. Therefore this
        tool was written to allow the flexibility in how information is linked together.
        
        This project is a real work in progress. This was hastily built to solve a problem I was
        having, and as a result many aspects of the project are sub-par.
        
        Supported commands:
        ```
        ProjectScope Initialize
        ```
        Creates a new project in the current working directory.
        
        
        ```
        ProjectScope Viewer
        ```
        Open a 3D project visualizer application. Requires GUI.
