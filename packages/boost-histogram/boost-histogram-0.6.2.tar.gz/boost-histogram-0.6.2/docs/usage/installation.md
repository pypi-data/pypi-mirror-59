# Installation

To install boost-histogram, just run:

```bash
pip install boost-histogram
```

This will get the latest version from PyPI. On most platforms, the install should be nearly instant, as it will be using a binary "wheel".


If you use conda, you can instead do:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge boost-histogram
```
