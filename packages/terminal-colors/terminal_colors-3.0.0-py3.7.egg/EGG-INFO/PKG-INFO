Description: My goal in writing this script was to provide all the functionality of all the
        various perl/sh scripts found around the web in one place with some additional
        bells and whistles.
        
        It automatically detects 8, 16, 88, 256 color capabilities (via ncurses) and
        displays the appropriate color charts. It can display the colors as blocks or
        (2d) cubes optionally with color values overlaid in int or hex values.  It can
        show the full rgb text string as well. It can also show the display with a
        vertical (default) or horizontal orientation or have additional padding.
        
        It also works as a utility for converting between 256 and 88 color values.
