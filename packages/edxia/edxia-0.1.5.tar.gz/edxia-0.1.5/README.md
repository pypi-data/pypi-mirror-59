[Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_electron_microscope "Wikipedia link") coupled with [Energy-Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDX)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy-dispersive_X-ray_spectroscopy "wikipedia link") is an imaging technique used in the cement community to learn more about the microstructure of the material.

This python package aims to offer tools to analyse and correlate this information.

## Features

- [Glue](http://glueviz.org/)  plugins to provide a user-friendly way to identify phases an measure distributions
- python API to automate analysis
- based on robust and well-known framework such as scipy/scikit-image/pandas
