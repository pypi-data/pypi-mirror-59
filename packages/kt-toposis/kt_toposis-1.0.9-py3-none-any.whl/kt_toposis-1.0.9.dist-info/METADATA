# kt-toposis

kt-toposis is a Python package for displaying ranking of all criteria using Topsis technique to get good computational efficiency and ability to measure the relative performance for each alternative in a simple mathematical form. 

## Topsis Description

Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is one of the multi-criteria models in making decision which is known for its  simplicity, rationality, comprehensibility and good computational efficiency. Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) refers to making choice of the best alternative from among a finite set of decision alternatives in terms of multiple, usually conflicting criteria.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you to install and use this package for general use. 

## Prerequisites

Your csv file should not have categorical data


## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
pip install kt-toposis
```

## Usage
You can import it either in Python IDLE or run directly through command prompt

### For Command Prompt

If you want to use this package on "data.csv" file with 4 columns. You need to change the directory where "data.csv" is stored then. Here -w represents weights which signifies weight of each feature or column in our dataset and -i represents impacts which signifies impact of each column or feature in our data. If a feature is good we will use + to denote else we will use -

```bash
kt-toposis data.csv -w 1 1 1 1 -i + + - +
```
You can use the following command for help

```bash
kt-toposis -h
```

### For Python IDLE

```python
from kt_toposis.topsis import top
top(X,weights,impacts)

#X should be a matrix
#impacts should be a list of string + for positive impact - for negative impact
#weights should be a list of int or float
```
### Sample dataset


|Singer ID	   |Sur     |Taal	|Laaye	|Pitch	|Pace|
| ------------ |:------:|:-----:| -----:|------:|:---:       
|S1	     	   | 0.79   | 0.62	|1.25	|60.89	|11  |
|S2	    	   | 0.66   | 0.44	|2.89	|3.07	|20  | 
|S3	    	   | 0.56   |0.31	|1.57	|62.87	|16  | 
|S4	    	   | 0.82   |0.67	|2.68	|70.19	|16  |
|S5	    	   | 0.75   |0.56	|1.3	|80.39	|20  |

```python
kt-toposis Book1.csv -w 1 1 1 1 1 -i + + + + +
```

### Result

```python
