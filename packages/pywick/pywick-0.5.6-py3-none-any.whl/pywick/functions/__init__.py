Here you can find a collection of functions that are used in neural networks. One of the most important aspects of a neural
network is a good activation function. Pytorch already has a solid `collection <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#non-linear-activations-weighted-sum-nonlinearity/>`_
of activation functions but here are a few more experimental ones to play around with.
