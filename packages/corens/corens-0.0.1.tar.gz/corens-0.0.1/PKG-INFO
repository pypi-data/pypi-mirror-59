Description: # core.NS - functional Python with Namespaces.
        
          core.NS is a Application Framework built around functional approach in the Python
        programming language. There is no objects or "object-oriented" approach as we know.
        Second "pillar" of the core.NS is an idea of "Namespaces". And based on those two concepts, we will be building our applications.
        
        ## First steps
        
          As a first steps, you will be expected, that there is a guidance on how to install
        and do the first try-run of the tool.
        
        ### Installation
          ```
          pip install -U corens
          ```
        
        ### ... in the beginning
          ```
          Python 3.7.4 (default, Jul  9 2019, 18:13:23)
          [Clang 10.0.1 (clang-1001.0.46.4)] on darwin
          Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
          >>> from corens import *
          >>> ns, f, F = NS()
          >>> f("/bin/stamp")()
          1578869315.8705332
          >>>
          ```
        
          In this example, you are creating a namespace, alongside with partially-evaluated functions for resolving and executing functions in namespace and partially-evaluated function for exporting namespace functions into a builtin functions. Then you are resolving and executing partially-evaluated function referred as _/bin/stamp_ inside namespace. This function will return you a current timestamp.
