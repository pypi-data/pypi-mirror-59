Description: 
        Sphinx reStructuredText Builder
        *******************************
        
        `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_ extension to build reST (`reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_) files.
        
        This extension is in particular useful to use in combination with the autodoc
        extension to automatically generate documentation for use by any rst parser
        (such as the GitHub wiki).
        
        In itself, the extension is fairly straightforward – it takes the parsed reST
        file from `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_ and outputs it as reST.
        
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        * `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_ 2.0 or later
        
        * Python 3.6 or later
        
        
        Installing
        ==========
        
        
        Using pip
        ---------
        
        ..
        
           pip install sphinx-rst-builder
        
        
        Manual
        ------
        
        ..
        
           git clone `https://github.com/davidfritzsche/sphinx-rst-builder.git <https://github.com/davidfritzsche/sphinx-rst-builder.git>`_
           cd sphinx-rst-builder
           python setup.py install
        
        If you want to take a look and have a try, you can put the reST builder in
        an extension subdirectory, and adjust ``sys.path`` to tell Sphinx where to
        look for it:
        
        * Add the extensions directory to the path in ``conf.py``. E.g.
        
          ..
             sys.path.append(os.path.abspath(‘exts’))
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        * Set the builder as a extension in ``conf.py``:
        
          ..
             extensions = [‘sphinx_rst_builder’]
        
        * Run sphinx-build with target ``rst``:
        
          ..
             sphinx-build -b rst -c . build/rst
        
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        The following four configuration variables are defined by sphinxcontrib.restbuilder:
        
        ``rst_file_suffix``
        
           This is the file name suffix for generated reST files.  The default is
           ``".rst"``.
        
        ``rst_link_suffix``
        
           Suffix for generated links to reST files.  The default is whatever
           ``rst_file_suffix`` is set to.
        
        ``rst_file_transform``
        
           Function to translate a docname to a filename.
           By default, returns *docname* + ``rst_file_suffix``.
        
        ``rst_link_transform``
        
           Function to translate a docname to a (partial) URI.
           By default, returns *docname* + ``rst_link_suffix``.
        
        ``rst_preserve_code_block_flags``
        
           Preserve (some) ``.. code-block::`` flags if *True*. Default is *False*.
        
        
        Further Reading
        ===============
        
        * `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_
        
        * `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_
        
        
        Feedback
        ========
        
        The reST builder is in a preliminary state. It’s not (yet) widely used, so
        any feedback is particularly welcome.
