jk_xmlparser
=============

Introduction
------------

This python module parses XML (and HTML) files.

Please be aware that this parser has some unique features like leaving entities unprocessed, and therefore does not follow the XML standards in all aspects. Therefore this parser might may not be suitable for all purposes (while at the same time the 100% standard-compliant XML parsers are not suitable for specific purposes in which this parser excels.)
