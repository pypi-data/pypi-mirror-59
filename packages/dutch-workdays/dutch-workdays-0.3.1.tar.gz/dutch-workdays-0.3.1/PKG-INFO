Description: Dutch Workdays
        ==============
        
        A very small library that handles with Dutch calendars and holidays ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±
        
        Installing
        ----------
        
        ```
        pip install dutch-workdays
        ```
            
        Usage
        -----
        
        ```python
        from dutch_workdays import Calendar
        cal = Calendar()
        cal.get_king_queen_day(2018)
        # (datetime.date(2018, 4, 27), "King's day")
        ```
        
        `dutch-workdays` works as a drop-in replacement of workalendar_, so for the
        rest of the API please refer to
        the `workdays documentation`_.
        
        Why not just using Workalendar instead?
        ---------------------------------------
        
        Workalendar is an awesome library, it's very complete and very well maintained
        but it's, unfortunately, quite a big dependency as well. It not only includes
        Python code to handle calendars from most of the world, but it also requires C
        libraries to calculate high-precision astronomy computations. It's an overkill
        if you only need to know about Dutch holidays.
        
        Differences from Workalendar
        ----------------------------
        
        - All the codebase is type annotated.
        - Zero dependencies
        - Dateutil easter calculation is vendorized.
