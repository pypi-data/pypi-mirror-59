Iteration
    A single run of your benchmarked function.
Round
    A set of iterations. The size of a `round` is computed in the calibration phase.

    Stats are computed with rounds, not with iterations. The duration for a round is an average of all the iterations in that round.

    See: :doc:`calibration` for an explanation of why it's like this.
