Description: 
        The Onion Box
        =============
        
        *The Onion Box* provides a web interface to monitor the operation of a
        `Tor <https://www.torproject.org>`__ node. It is able to monitor any Tor
        node operated as relay, as bridge and even as client - as long as it can
        establish a connection to the node and authenticate successfully.
        
        The connection to the Tor node to be monitored may be established via a
        local ``ControlSocket`` or a ``ControlPort`` (local or remote). Advanced
        users may establish a connection via the Tor network to a node proving
        access to itâ€™s ``ControlPort`` by means of a Hidden Service - supporting
        on demand as well `Hidden Service Client
        Authorization <https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en#HiddenServiceAuthorizeClient>`__.
        
        *The Onion Box* supports whatever authentication method the Tor node
        provides.
        
        A single instance of *The Onion Box* is able to provide monitoring
        functionality for as many nodes as you like.
        
        Above that, *The Onion Box* is able to display Tor network status
        protocol data for any Tor node known by
        `Onionoo <http://onionoo.torproject.org>`__.
