We will use the traditional Pomodoro scheme:

### It is important:
**According to the principle of the Pomodoro technique - if you are
distracted while doing work, then you must interrupt the current time
and start a new Pomodoro. And this means that you need to write time in to
the database only after the specified time has passed and not earlier.**

**If you follow this principle, the Pomodoro Technique will be for you exactly 
the tool for which it was invented, namely, not to calculate the time of your 
work and breaks in work, but to make you concentrate on continuous and 
concentrated execution of works during one Pomodoro, i.e. within 25 minutes.**

We call the program from any directory in the console and set the countdown 
time:

When the time ends, a sound signal will be played, push notification will be 
displayed and it is proposed to enter a new countdown time. And also, it will 
display the time that is OUT, in the form of a colored time bar, where:
- red color - working time (25 minutes)
- green color - time for a short or long break (5, 15 or 30 minutes)

The type of push notification depends on your OS and the type of graphical 
shell used, for example:
