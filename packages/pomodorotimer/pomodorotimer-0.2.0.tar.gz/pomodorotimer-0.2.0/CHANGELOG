- Fixed a bug


Version 0.1.1 (31.12.2019)
--------------------------

- Updated: README
- Changed:
    In order to hide the output of debugging information of the audio
    player, we will transfer the playback/generation code of the audio
    to a separate file and we will call this script in the background.
    Why so? - because standard output redirection does not work due to
    the specifics of ffmpeg it self.
    The process itself is needed to play the WAV file or the generated sound.
- Fixed some bugs


Version 0.1.0 (30.12.2019)
