Description: Manager for TACL catalogue files
        ================================
        
        This package provides a library and script to merge multiple lists of
        TACL works together in a specified order, and output one or more
        catalogue files using supplied labels.
        
        The merging process applies the name of the first file to list a work
        to that work; all subsequent names for that work are ignored. This
        allows for different categorisations of works to be put in a priority
        order.
        
        The process of creating catalogue files makes use of mappings between
        the filenames of the work lists and labels to be used in the
        catalogue. Multiple filenames may map onto a single label. The order
        of the labels in the mapping is maintained in the catalogue file.
