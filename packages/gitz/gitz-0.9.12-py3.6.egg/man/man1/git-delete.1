.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Delete each branch specified together with its remote branch.
.sp
By default, branches named \fImaster\fP and \fIdevelop\fP are protected,
which means they cannot be deleted, and the remote \fIupstream\fP is protected,
which means that no branches on that remote can be deleted.
.sp
Using the \-\-all/\-a flag allows protected branches and remotes
to be deleted.
.sp
It\(aqs also possible to change which branches or remotes are protected
by setting the environment variable GITZ_PROTECTED_BRANCHES or
GITZ_PROTECTED_REMOTES to a list separated by colons, or to an empty
string to turn off protection entirely.
.SH DANGER
.sp
Deletes remote branches!
