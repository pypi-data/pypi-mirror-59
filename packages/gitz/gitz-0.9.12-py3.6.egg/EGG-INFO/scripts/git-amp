git amp:
    AMend the last commit message and force-Push, somewhat safely

USAGE:
    git amp [commit message here]

DANGER:
    Rewrites history!

DESCRIPTION:
    AMend the last commit message and force Push to its upstream branch.

    If arguments are given, they are used as the commit message,
    otherwise an editor is brought up to create one.

    git amp rewrites history and should only be used on private branches.
    For your protection, 'git amp' will fail with a message if there are
    any changes in your workspace which would get accidentally mixed into
    the previous commit.

EXAMPLES:
    git amp
        Bring up an editor for a new commit message, then amend and push

    git amp Your new commit message here
        Amend and push with the message "Your new commit message here"

    git amp "Commit message! (fix #127)"
        Amend and push with message "Commit message! (fix #127)"
        (You need quotes if the message includes special shell
        characters like #, ', ", *, ?, !)
