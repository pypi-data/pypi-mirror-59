# Bruker2nifti

[Bruker2nifti](https://github.com/SebastianoF/bruker2nifti) is an open source medical image format converter from raw [Bruker](http://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/imaging/FormatBruker)
ParaVision to [NifTi](https://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1), without any intermediate step through the [DICOM](http://dicom.nema.org/standard.html) standard formats.

Bruker2nifti is a pip-installable pure Python tool provided with a Graphical User Interface and a Command Line Utility to access the conversion method.

### Before Getting Started

Since the release of ParaVision360v1.1, a NifTi format converter is natively embedded and would provide the long sought standard. Please consider this option before starting with bruker2nifti. 

### Getting Started

+ Requirements
    - Python 3 backward compatible with python 2.7
    - Libraries in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/SebastianoF/bruker2nifti/blob/master/requirements.txt).

+ Installation
    - Install the [latest stable release](https://github.com/SebastianoF/bruker2nifti/releases) with `pip install bruker2nifti`.
    - [Install the latest development version](https://github.com/SebastianoF/bruker2nifti/wiki/Installing-stable-version-and-development-version) with `pip install -e .`.

+ Real data examples
    - [Python-Ipython session](https://github.com/SebastianoF/bruker2nifti/wiki/Example:-use-bruker2nifti-in-a-python-(Ipython)-session).
    - [Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://github.com/SebastianoF/bruker2nifti/wiki/Example:-use-bruker2nifti-via-Command-Line-Interface).
    - [Graphical User Interface (GUI)](https://github.com/SebastianoF/bruker2nifti/wiki/Graphical-User-Interface-Examples).

## Accessing only the GUI with no Python knowledge required
