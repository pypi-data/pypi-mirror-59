Obsea metamorphoses Ocean-Bottom Seismometers (OBS) into watchful observers of the Oceans. Sensing infrasound, OBSs can record marine mammal vocalizes, ship traffic noise, iceberg activity and more at very long rages (~100 km). This package aims at automatically recognizing and localizing acoustical sources that can be recorded by OBSs transforming this latter into an efficient acoustic passive sonar.
