#  Sprite Sheet
    A sprite is a small raster graphic (a bitmap) that represents an object such as a character, a vehicle, a projectile, etc.
    
    Sprites are a popular way to create large, complex scenes as you can manipulate each sprite separately from the rest of the scene. This allows for greater control over how the scene is rendered, as well as over how the players can interact with the scene.
