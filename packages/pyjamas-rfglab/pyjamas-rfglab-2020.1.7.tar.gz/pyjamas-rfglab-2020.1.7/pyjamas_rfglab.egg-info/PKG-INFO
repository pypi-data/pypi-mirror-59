Description: # PyJAMAS
        
        [**Py**JAMAS](https://bitbucket.org/rfg_lab/pyjamas/src/master/) is **J**ust **A** **M**ore **A**wesome **S**iesta.
        
        ## Installing PyJAMAS
        The easiest way to install [PyJAMAS](https://bitbucket.org/rfg_lab/pyjamas/src/master/) is using [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/pyjamas-rfglab/). 
        
        ### A note on the *Python interpreter*
        [PyJAMAS](https://bitbucket.org/rfg_lab/pyjamas/src/master/) requires that you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.  
        
        [PyJAMAS](https://bitbucket.org/rfg_lab/pyjamas/src/master/) has been extensively tested with with [Python 3.6.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-368/) and subsequent versions. [PyJAMAS](https://bitbucket.org/rfg_lab/pyjamas/src/master/) can probably work well with other Python 3.6 releases prior to 3.6.8. However, we use type annotations, so Python versions prior to 3.6 will not work.  
        
        [PyJAMAS](https://bitbucket.org/rfg_lab/pyjamas/src/master/) does **NOT** work with Python 2. 
        
        If you are interested in using [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for your research, you should consider installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section), a scientific Python distribution. 
        
        ### MacOS and Linux
        Open a terminal. If you had previously installed [PyJAMAS](https://bitbucket.org/rfg_lab/pyjamas/src/master/), we recommend uninstalling the previous version:
        
        ```python
        pip uninstall pyjamas-rfglab
        ```
         
        To install [PyJAMAS](https://bitbucket.org/rfg_lab/pyjamas/src/master/), type:  
        
        ```python
        pip install pyjamas-rfglab
        ```
        
        To run [PyJAMAS](https://bitbucket.org/rfg_lab/pyjamas/src/master/), type:  
        
        ```python
        pyjamas
        ```
        
        at the user prompt.  
        
        ### Windows
        We recommend that, before installing [PyJAMAS](https://bitbucket.org/rfg_lab/pyjamas/src/master/), you install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section) (a scientific Python distribution). In principle, the [PyJAMAS](https://bitbucket.org/rfg_lab/pyjamas/src/master/) [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/pyjamas-rfglab/) package is self-contained, and will install all the necessary modules. However, in Windows there is an issue with [Shapely](https://pypi.org/project/Shapely/), a package used in [PyJAMAS](https://bitbucket.org/rfg_lab/pyjamas/src/master/) to represent geometric objects such as points or polygons. [Shapely](https://pypi.org/project/Shapely/) is based on [GEOS](https://trac.osgeo.org/geos/), a C++ library that comes with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section) but that fails to install with the [PyJAMAS](https://bitbucket.org/rfg_lab/pyjamas/src/master/) [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/pyjamas-rfglab/) package. It is recommended to start by manually installing [Shapely](https://pypi.org/project/Shapely/). To that end, download the appropriate Shapely version from [this link](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#shapely). For example, use  Shapely‑1.6.4.post1‑cp36‑cp36m‑win_amd64.whl for a 64-bit machine running [Python 3.6]((https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-368/)). Open a command prompt and change into the folder that contains the downloaded .whl file using the **cd** command. Complete the installation of [Shapely](https://pypi.org/project/Shapely/) by typing:
        
        ```python
        pip install Shapely‑1.6.4.post1‑cp36‑cp36m‑win_amd64.whl
        ```
        substituting the downloaded file name.
        
        
        Once [Shapely](https://pypi.org/project/Shapely/), has been set up, you can proceed with a regular [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/pyjamas-rfglab/) installation of [PyJAMAS](https://bitbucket.org/rfg_lab/pyjamas/src/master/). Just be sure to read our note on the interpreter [above](#a-note-on-the-interpreter). After that, open a command prompt and type:  
        
        ```python
        pip install pyjamas-rfglab
        ```
        
        To run [PyJAMAS](https://bitbucket.org/rfg_lab/pyjamas/src/master/) type:  
        
        ```python
        pyjamas
        ```
        
        at the user prompt.
