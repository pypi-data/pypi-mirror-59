Description: # overpython
        Overcomplicated Python. Kinda pointless.
        I got bored, so I made this pointless project.
        
        Aside from overcomplicating Python, it also adds a few new functions such as newFile() and printnl().
        There are a few things that completely defeat the purpose of overcomplicating Python, such as `from overpython import *`
        # Installation
        There's no official PyPi package right now. So just do the following:
          1. Download overpython as a zip file.
          2. Put overpython.py in a folder.
          3. Type `import overpython` as the first line
          4. Enjoy your abomination!
        # Example code
        ```py
        import overpython
        
        overpython.clear()
        overpython.println("Sir, can i have your name?")
        name = overpython.get("Name: ")
        name = overpython.tolower(name)
        if overpython.equals(name, "John"):
            overpython.println("Sorry John, you're going to jail son.")
        else:
            overpython.println("Thanks, " + overpython.tolower(name))
        overpython.pause()
        ```
        Output:
        ```
        Hello my habibi 489
        Press the ENTER key to exit...
        ```
