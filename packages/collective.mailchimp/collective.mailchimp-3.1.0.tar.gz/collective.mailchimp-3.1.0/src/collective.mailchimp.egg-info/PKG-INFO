        Introduction

        MailChimp integration for Plone 4 and 5.
        
        MailChimp helps you design email newsletters, share them on social networks, integrate with services you already use, and track your results.
        
        collective.mailchimp provides a @newsletter view to let visitors subscribe to one or more MailChimp mailing lists. It also provides a MailChimp portlet in case you want to display your newsletter subscription as part of an existing site.
        
        The newsletter subscriptions forms in both the view and the portlet are extendable, so you can add custom fields that can be stored in your MailChimp subscriber list.
        
        It also comes with a MailChimp control panel to let you enter your MailChimp credentials for your Plone site.
        
        collective.mailchimp is tested on Plone 4.x and 5.x and should work on Plone > 3.3
        (with the appropriate version pins for plone.app.registry and z3c.form).
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Install collective.mailchimp by adding it to your buildout::
        
          [buildout]
        
          ...
        
          eggs =
              collective.mailchimp
        
        and then running "bin/buildout".
        
        
        Multiple MailChimp Lists
        ========================
        
        collective.mailchimp supports multiple MailChimp lists. The MailChimp portlet
        allows administators to choose a MailChimp list from a dropdown list for each
        portlet. The MailChimp newsletter view (@@newsletter) allows to provide a
        list_id (see your MailChimp account) as optional URL parameter::
        
          http://localhost:8080/Plone/@@newsletter?list_id=f3247645gs
        
        If no URL parameter is provided the form just chooses the first MailChimp list
        available (which is fine as long as you have just one list anyway).
        
        
        Preselect Interest Groups
        =========================
        
        collective.mailchimp supports MailChimp's interest groups. In case there is more than one single group you might want to pre-select some of the groups. To
        do so add one or more 'preselect_group' parameters to the URL that points to
        your MailChimp newsletter form. For instance to select the first and the fifth
        group entry use the following link::
        
            http://localhost:8080/Plone/@@newsletter?preselect_group=0&preselect_group=4
        
        Note: if you used version 1.4.1 of collective.mailchimp or earlier,
        you may no longer see the interest groups on the subscribe form.  You
        should visit the control panel again.  This will update the data
        automatically.
        
        
        Extend Newsletter Subscription Form
        ===================================
        
        The collective.mailchimp newsletter form (used in the separate view as well
        as in the portlet) can be extended without touching the code of
        collective.mailchimp.

        History
        =======
        
        collective.mailchimp has been written from the scratch in order to replace
        raptus.mailchimp_ for newer versions of Plone (> 4.0).
        
        .. _MailChimp: http://mailchimp.com
        .. _raptus.mailchimp: http://plone.org/products/raptus.mailchimp
        
        The difference between collective.mailchimp and raptus.mailchimp is:
        
        - Directly use the MailChimp API instead of greatape_ as Python wrapper (because greatape is completely untested, does not support the latest MailChimp API version and seems to be not actively developed any longer)
        - z3c.form_ instead of formlib for forms (because formlib is deprecated)
        - plone.app.registry_ instead of portal_properties for storing properties (because portal_properties will be deprecated soon)
        - it is tested by automated software tests (because untested code is broken code)
        
        .. _greatape: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/greatape
        .. _z3c.form: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/z3c.form
        .. _plone.app.registry: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.app.registry

          dependency on Plone 5.0 (CMFPlone) and optional on Plone 5.1.

          [ichim-david]
        
        
        2.0.2 (2016-02-02)
        ------------------
        
        Bugfixes:
        
        - Fixed MANIFEST.in so all files are added.  Releases 2.0 and 2.0.1
          were missing non Python files.  [maurits]
        
        
        2.0.1 (2016-01-29)
        ------------------
        
        Bugfixes:
        
        - Add upgrade step to reload new src folder. Make sure you run the upgrade step, otherwise the add-on will not work properly. This fixes https://github.com/collective/collective.mailchimp/issues/21.
          [timo]
        
        
        2.0 (2016-01-28)
        ----------------
        
        - Move code to src folder to follow best practice.
          [timo]
        
        - Set default value for interests to '{}' instead of None. This fixes https://github.com/collective/collective.mailchimp/issues/19.
          [timo]
        
        - Added support for Plone 5, kept 4.3 compatibility.
          [jladage, didrix, maurits]
        
        - Updated to version 3.0 of the mailchimp api.  The data that we get
          from mailchimp with this api version is changed.  When you have
          interest groups in your lists, and you do not see them anymore on
          the subscribe form, you should visit the control panel again.  This
          will update the data automatically.
          [jladage, didrix, maurits]
        
        - Remove bare excepts.
          [timo]
        
        
        1.4.1 (2015-05-04)
        ------------------
        
        - Try to avoid some needless registry updates.
          [maurits]
        
        - Disable inline validation in the mailchimp control panel.  It may
          change the cache based on a new api key that the user has not yet
          saved.
          [maurits]
        
        - Remove mailchimp object before updating cache.  Otherwise a change
          in the api key is not picked up until after a restart.
          [maurits]
        
        
        1.4.0 (2015-04-29)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix invalid pypi classifier.
          [timo]
        
        - Show control panel even when api key is invalid.
          Fixes issue #8.

          "KeyError: 'Interface .. defines a field .., for which there is no record.'"
          [timo]
