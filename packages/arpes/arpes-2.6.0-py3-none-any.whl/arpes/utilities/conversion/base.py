        The CoordinateConverter.prep method allows you to pre-compute some transformations
        that are common to the individual coordinate transform methods as an optimization.

        This is useful if you want the conversion methods to have separation of concern,
        but if it is advantageous for them to be able to share a computation of some
        variable. An example of this is in BE-kx-ky conversion, where computing k_p_tot
        is a step in both converting kx and ky, so we would like to avoid doing it twice.

        Of course, you can neglect this function entirely. Another technique is to simple
        cache computations as they arrive. This is the technique that is used in
        ConvertKxKy below
