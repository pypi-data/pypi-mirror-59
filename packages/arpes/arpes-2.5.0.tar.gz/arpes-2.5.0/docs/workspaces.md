## Workspaces

Note: you can safely opt out of most of this. However, PyARPES can keep projects neatly separated for you (including 
generated files like figures and analysis records) if you opt into the workspaces model. If you don't want to use it,
you can use `load_without_dataset` according to the previous section. 

PyARPES makes a few assumptions about the organization of your data and analysis so that it can organize figures and 
cross-reference data from the same sample or experiment. In the desired location (for instance your Documents folder
or wherever you would like to keep your analysis notebooks), copy or clone the folder structure from the
[arpes-analysis-scaffold repository](https://gitlab.com/lanzara-group/arpes-analysis-scaffold).

Separate analysis workspaces are stored as folders inside `datasets`. All data for a given project/workspace is 
stored in the `data` folder inside a workspace. Once you have copied the analysis scaffold structure, start a Jupyter session, inside the `example` 
folder you should find these files:

![Example Folder Structure](static/jupyter-file-structure.png)

Every project will have roughly this structure at its core: a `data` folder with the raw data for analysis,
some or many analysis notebooks, and one or more spreadsheets which the analysis code uses to order and add 
extra information to the raw data.

The analysis code will only load data that is listed in a spreadsheet. A minimal spreadsheet includes two columns: 
`file` and `location` 

![Example Spreadsheet](static/spreadsheet.png)

`file` refers to a fragment of the filename or the file index for the raw data inside `data`, while `location` 
indicates which lab spectrometer or synchrotron endstation produced the data (necessary to automate data-loading).
Currently most ARPES endstations at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) are supported 
(location values: BL4, BL403, BL7, BL702, BL10). More endstations can be added quickly as [plugins](/writing-plugins).

## Configuring imports and startup

Because you have the freedom to place your data/analysis folders wherever you like, 
PyARPES has to be told where you put it in order to organize data and figures for you (alternatively, 
you can [load data ad-hoc](/ad-hoc)). You can either perform this configuration in an IPython Kernel startup script (see for 
instance [this guide](http://www.gilgalad.co.uk/post/jupyter-kernel/) or talk to Conrad), or just run 
the `setup` function, which will also import useful pieces of code into the global scope.

The second argument should be the full path to the folder containing the `datasets` and `figures` folder. 
This should be performed at the top of every notebook you use, or in your kernel startup, which has the same effect.
