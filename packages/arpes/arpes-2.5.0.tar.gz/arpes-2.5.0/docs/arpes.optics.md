# arpes.optics module

Some utilities for optics and optical design. This and the utilities in
arpes.laser should maybe be grouped into a separate place.

We don’t do any astigmatism aware calculations here, which might be of
practical utility.

Things to offer in the future:

1.    - Calculating beam characteristics (beam divergence, focus, etc)  
        from a sequence of knife edge tests or beam profiler images in
        order to facilitate common tasks like beam collimation,
        focusing, or preparing a new Tr-ARPES setup.

2.    - Nonlinear optics utilities including damage thresholds to
        allow  
        simpler design of harmonic generation for Tr-ARPES.
