# arpes.bootstrap module

Contains tools pertaining to statistical boostraps. It can sometimes be
difficult to assess when bootstraps are appropriate, so make sure to
consider this before you just stick a bootstrap around your code and
stuff the resultant error bar into your papers.

This is most useful on data coming from ToF experiments, where
individual electron arrivals are counted, but even here you must be
aware of tricky aspects of the experiment: ToF-ARPES analyzers are not
perfect, their efficiency can vary dramatically across the detector due
to MCP burn-in, and electron aberration and focusing must be considered.
