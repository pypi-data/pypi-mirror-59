# arpes.experiment package

## Module contents

This module is a work-in-progress. Ideally, we would one day like to
offer a simple graphical utility that can communicate with various ARPES
DAQ hardware using a file based interchange format. Currently, DAQ
sequences roughly consistent with the capabilities of the MAESTRO
beamlines are supported via JSON.

More capabiities are also available for Tr-ARPES (shuffling to prevent
laser and drift skewing datasets) with more to come.
