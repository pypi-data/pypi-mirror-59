`travis-wait-improved` is a tool to prevent Travis-CI from thinking a
long-running process has stalled.  It will start a child process,
and pass its output through along with keep-alive messages.

For example, if you wanted to run a packer build that could take up
to 30 minutes, you would add the following to your `.travis.yml` file:

```yml
before_deploy:
  - pip install travis-wait-improved

deploy:
  - provider: script
    script: travis-wait-improved --timeout 30m packer build packer.json
```

## Requirements ##
