# KeepThis

## About project

Scientific toolkit which will inspire you and your team to work with more collaboration than ever before.

It works almost like LRU Cache but allows you:
1. Use same cache in different processes;
2. Use same cache at the different moments of time;
3. Easily share your local runtime's results with your teammates!  

Using [memcached](https://memcached.org) as a backend allows you to cache really large things.

## Try it!

### How to install

Install the package.

1. Clone this repo
2. Open repo's root path in terminal
3. Install package using `pip install -e .`

Please ensure that you have memcached instance. 
I recommend you to use docker image for your first-time interactions with library:
```bash
docker run -d --rm -p 11211:11211 memcached
```
