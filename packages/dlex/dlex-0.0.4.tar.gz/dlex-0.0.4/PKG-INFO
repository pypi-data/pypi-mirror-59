Description: [!] This code is under development and mainly for my personal use. This project is for fast prototyping of deep learning and machine learning model with minimal code. Some parts of the code may not be well-commented or lack of citation.
        
        dlex is an open source framework for machine learning scientific experiment. 
        
        # Features
        
        - [ ] Configuration-based experiment setup. Less code for more reproducibility
        - [ ] Pytorch or Tensorflow 2.0 or scikit-learn as backend with similar training flow
        - [ ] Efficiently log, report and analyze experiment results
        - [ ] Cross-platform GUI for monitoring experiments, either local or remote sever (Electron-based)
