Transport In a Non-Interacting Equilibrium simulation framework (TINIE)
======================================================================


Overview
--------
We present to you a code that calculates conductance and electric current
running through 2D cavities, quantum dots or potential wells with arbitrarily
placed reservoirs in a perpendicular and constant magnetic field. The code can
be used in a wide range of calculations involving 2D electron transport. The
main difference between this code and its competitors is the fact that TINIE
does not need to be provided with free parameters. The code is parallelized 
with `mpi4py`, allowing for computational tasks distribution across multiple 
processors. 


Installation
------------
The code is a Python package (written using Python 3.6). Installation of the 
package is as easy as typing  `python3 setup.py install`. Thorough unit testing 
for the package has been  implemented and can be launched via `python3 setup.py test`. 
The package has scripts with a parser user interface, which need to be given 
appropriate permissions prior to their execution. To that end, the following commands 
must be run from the git root repository: 
```bash 
$ source dev_setup.sh
$ scripts/tinie_prepare -dE 1e-7 ...
$ scripts/tinie -i "transport_equilibrium/test_files/preptinie_test.h5" -dw
$ 1e-5 ...
```


Package Functionality
---------------------
This package contains tools that could be used to calculate coupling of a
specific system that contains a central region (2DEG) and some leads.  After
the coupling is calculated one could proceed to calculate transmission
coefficients and partial currents in the leads. All the calculations are
performed in Hartee atomic units. After installing the package, a simple test
run can be launched from the git root directory as follows:
```bash
$ scripts/tinie_prepare
$ scripts/tinie
```

Package Structure
-----------------
The code is written using object-oriented programming, and its functionality
can be shortly described in the following way: first, `Lead`, and `Center`
objects are created and passed as inputs for the `Coupling` object and then all
of them are passed into a `SystemDump` object, which calculates all the
couplings and Hamiltonians and dumps the data into an hdf5 file. `SystemFetch`
is then used to read the data from that hdf5 file. That data is passed into the
`Calculator` interface, where `SelfEnergy` interface calculates the
self-energies $`\Sigma_{L}(\omega)`$ and rate operators $`\Gamma_{L}(\omega)`$
using the `Coupling` and the eigenenergies of the `Lead`. 

After that, `SelfEnergy` for all the leads and the eigenenergies of the
`Center` are passed into the `GreenFunction` interface that evaluates the
advanced ($`G^{A}(\omega)`$) and retarded ($`G^{R}(\omega)`$) Green's
functions, finalizing the initialization of the `Calculator`. From there the
code is able to compute the transmission matrix
$`\mathcal{T}_{\alpha\beta}(\omega)=\mathrm{Tr}[G^{R}(\omega)\Gamma_{\beta}(\omega)G^{A}(\omega)\Gamma_{\alpha}(\omega)]`$
and the partial currents 
```math
i_{\alpha\beta}=2\int_{\omega}\mathrm{d}\omega\frac{1}{2\pi}[f(\omega-V_{\alpha}-\mu)-f(\omega-V_{\beta}-\mu)]\mathcal{T}_{\alpha\beta}(\omega)
``` 
in the lead, where $`f(E)`$ is the Fermi-Dirac energy distribution. Furthermore, 
it is then  possible to compute other transport properties, such as conductance 
at a specific temperature. Additionally, we include the possibility of computing
density of states and local density of states.

Modular structure of the code allows for the implementation of your own custom
type of conducting channel ("lead"), quantum dot ("central region") and
coupling via implementation of a class that inherits from `Lead`, `Center` or
`Coupling`. The details of how exactly the classes should be implemented will
be explained in the sections to follow.

Example: Usage of TINIE with ITP2D
----------------------------------
To better demonstrate how TINIE is used, we will show it by means of an example 
problem. We will compute transport properties of a quantum-dot system with two 
leads in a magnetic field. Specifically, we shall procure the information about 
the central region from ITP2D, a Schrödinger equation eigensolver that 
interfaces with TINIE. The following workflow is typical for most transport 
problems solved with TINIE:

**Step 0:** computation of the Hamiltonian and wavefunctions of the central 
region. We may obtain this information from any eigensolver of our choosing, 
provided that it is TINIE-compatible. Quantum dot may be modeled by a 
radial harmonic potential of form $`V(r)=\frac{1}{2}\omega_{0}\Vert r \Vert^{2}`$. 
Solving the first 25 states of this model with magnetic field strength $`B=1.0`$ is 
done in ITP2D as follows:
```bash
$ ./itp2d -v -n 20 -l 12 -s 100 -p "harmonic(1)" -B 1.0 -o ITP2D_FILE_PATH
```
Here the central region occupies a $`[-6,6]`$ region in both x- and y-directions 
and is centered at the origin. More information about usage of ITP2D can be 
found on its [bitbucket page](https://bitbucket.org/luukko/itp2d/src/master/).

**Step 1:** the transport system preparation step. In this step, the coupling 
matrices for the leads are computed. Suppose we wish to compute overlap 
coupling between the central region and the leads and we want to vary the probe 
energy within each lead in range $`[0.0,2.0]`$ with energy spacing of 
$`\Delta E = 0.001`$. In this case, the first 5 states of the central region are 
sufficient for the calculation. Our leads are such that:
* Lead 0 is confined to region $`[-10.0,-4.0]`$ in $`x`$-direction, $`[-5.0,5.0]`$ 
in $`y`$-direction and connects to the lead from the left;
* Lead 1 is confined to region $`[4.0,10.0]`$ in $`x`$-direction, $`[-5.0,5.0]`$ 
in $`y`$-direction and connects to the lead from the right.

Both leads in this case have harmonic potential of strength $`\omega=1.0`$ in 
$`y`$-direction, and particle-in-a-box potential in $`x`$-direction. This 
information is sufficient for us to commence the system preparation. For that, 
`tinie_prepare` script is used as follows:
```bash
$ tinie_prepare -dE 1e-3 -B 1.0 -ctr "itp2d(ITP2D_FILE_PATH,(0,4))" -l 2 -ld "finharm(left,1.0,dir)" "finharm(right,1.0,dir)" -xlim "[-10.0,-4.0]" "[4.0,10.0]" -ylim "[-5.0,5.0]" "[-5.0,5.0]" -Elim "[0.0,2.0]" "[0.0,2.0]" -cpl "overlap()" "overlap()" -o TINIE_PREPARE_FILE_PATH
```
This produces the PREPTINIEFile that contains the information about the 
coupling of the transport system which can be reused for different transport 
calculations of the next step.

**Step 2:** the transport calculation step. This is where the real fun begins, 
the steps before are in a sense just a preparation. To compute various 
transport properties of the system, such as transmission, conductance and 
current, we fix temperature of the system $`T=1.0`$, chemical potential $`\mu=1.0`$ 
and fix bias voltages in the leads to be $`V_{0}=0.5`$ in Lead 0 and $`V_{1}=1.5`$. 
Moreover, we adjust the energy spacing of probe electrons to 
$`\Delta\omega=0.01`$ and set the Green's function boundary parameter to 
$`\eta=0.1`$. With this information we can use `tinie` script as follows:
```bash
$ tinie -i TINIE_PREPARE_FILE_PATH -dw 1e-2 -eta 1e-1 -T 1.0 -mu 1.0 -V 0.5 1.5 -o TINIE_FILE_PATH
```
This produces the TINIEFile that contains all the above mentioned transport 
quantities and more, with detailed description of its contents outlined in the 
sections below.

In addition to the transport properties, we can compute local and standard 
density of states (LDOS/DOS) of the system via the `tinie_dos` script. To that 
end, in addition to the parameters specified above, user would want to 
specify the energies at which LDOS should be evaluated, as well as the 
location of the file with the central region wavefunctions. We then use the 
script as follows:
```bash
$ tinie_dos -i TINIE_PREPARE_FILE_PATH -psi ITP2D_FILE_PATH --wf-range 0 4 -w 1.0 2.0 3.0 -dw 1e-2 -eta 1e-1 -T 1.0 -mu 1.0 -V 0.5 1.5 -o TINIE_DOS_FILE_PATH
```
Here, we evaluated LDOS at probe energies $`\omega\in\{1.0,2.0,3.0\}`$. Results 
of this calculation are stored in TINIEDOSFile, with details about its contents 
available in sections below.

**Step 3:** visualizing the results. To that end, one can use the `tinie_draw` 
script. Suppose we want to plot transmission, conductance, total current and 
DOS of the system in the energy range $`[0.0,5.0]`$, as well as LDOS at probe 
energy $`\omega=1.0`$. We then use the following command:
```bash
$ tinie_draw -i TINIE_FILE_PATH -idos TINIE_DOS_FILE_PATH -E 0.0 5.0 --ldos-E 1.0 --transmission --conductance --total-currents --dos --ldos -o FIGURE_PATH
```
This will produce beautiful LaTeX-rendered plots of the aforementioned 
quantities. Below we show the example plots of conductance, DOS and LDOS 
produced by the script:

|Conductance                         |DOS                         | LDOS                          |

Quantum transport calculations in two-dimensional systems have never been as 
easy!

Currently Implemented System Classes
------------------------------------
As of now, the following system classes are implemented:
* `Center` objects, located in `transport_calculator/systems/central_region`
    * `Itp2dCenter`: itp2d-compatible interface.
    * `CustomCenter`: container for a custom predefined central region 
      Hamiltonian $`\mathbf{H}^{C}`$.
* `Lead` objects, located in `transport_calculator/systems/leads`. Note that
  wavefunction normalization has been omitted for the sake of compactness of
  the expression. Wavefunctions in the code are all normalized.
    * `FiniteHarmonicLead`: lead described by a wavefunction
      $`\psi^{L}_{k,l}(x,q)=\cos(k(x-x^{L}_{max})+\frac{\pi}{2})e^{-\frac{1}{2}q^2}H_{l}(q)`$,
      where $`H_{l}(q)`$ is the the Hermite polynomial of order $`l`$,
      $`q=\sqrt{\omega_{c0}y-\frac{l}{B}\frac{\omega^{2}_{c}}{\omega^{2}_{c0}}}`$,
      $`\omega_{c}=B,\omega^2_{c0}=\omega^2_0+\omega^2_c`$, with $`\omega_0`$
      being the frequency of quantum harmonic oscillator and $`B`$ being
      magnetic field strength. The formula is provided in Hartee atomic units.
      $`x`$ and $`y`$ coordinate wavefunctions are interchangeable depending on
      the lead alignment.
    * `BoxLead`: particle in a box lead describe by wavefunction
      $`\psi^{L}_{k,l}(x,y)=\sin(\frac{k\pi}{L_{x}}(x-x^L_{max}))\sin(\frac{l\pi}{L_{y}}(y-y^L_{max}))`$,
      where $`L_{x}`$ and $`L_{y}`$ are the length and width of the box
      correspondingly and $`k,l \in \mathbb{Z}_{+}\setminus \{0\}`$.
    * `CustomLead`: container for a custom predefined lead region Hamiltonian
      $`\mathbf{H}^{L}`$.
* `Coupling` objects, located in `transport_calculator/systems/couplings`
    * `OverlapCoupling`: strong coupling of the type
      $`\mathbf{V}_{ij}=-\frac{1}{2}\int_{\Omega}\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}\psi^{*}_{L,i}(\mathbf{r})\Delta\psi_{C,j}(\mathbf{r})`$,
      where $`\psi_{L,i}`$ is the $`i`$th eigenfunction of the lead and
      $`\psi_{C,j}`$ i
      s the $`j`$th eigenfunction of the central region and
      $`\Omega`$ is the overlap region of the lead and the quantum-dot.
    * `TightBindingCoupling`: weak coupling between non-overlapping lead and
      central regions of the type
      $`\mathbf{V}_{ij}=-\frac{1}{2}\int_{\Omega_{L}}\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r'}\psi^{*}_{L,i}(\mathbf{r'})\int_{\Omega_{C}}\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}\frac{\psi_{C,j}(\mathbf{r})}{||\mathbf{r'}-\mathbf{r}||^2}e^{-i\theta}`$,
      where $`\theta=-\frac{B}{2}(x'-x)(y'-y)`$, $`\Omega_{L}`$ is the lead
      region to be coupled and $`\Omega_{C}`$ is the central region to be
      coupled.
    * `OneLayerCoupling`: weak coupling between the boundaries of a
      non-overlapping lead and central regions of the type
      $`\mathbf{V}_{ij}=-\frac{1}{2}\int_{\partial
      \Omega_{L}}\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r'}\psi^{*}_{L,i}(\mathbf{r'})\int_{\partial
      \Omega_{C}}\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}\frac{\psi_{C,j}(\mathbf{r})}{||\mathbf{r'}-\mathbf{r}||^2}e^{-i\theta}`$.
    * `CustomCoupling`: container for custom predefined coupling matrix
      $`\mathbf{V}`$. Compatible only with `CustomCenter` and `CustomLead`
      objects.

The implementational details of these elements can be checked in the source
code, which is rich with insightful and helpful comments.

Adding Your Own Custom System Classes
-------------------------------------
As it has been mentioned before, the code has been designed in such a way as to
allow as much freedom in expansion as possible. In particular, you can
introduce additional types of central regions, lead regions and coupling
methods. All you have to do is to create your own class file in the
corresponding folder in `tinie/systems` and make sure that the
class you are creating inherits from one of the basic abstract classes
(`Center`, `Lead` or `Coupling`). Below you can find a list of functions you
would have to implement (correctly) in order for your custom class to be fully
integrated into the transport scheme:

* `Center` region:
    * `__init__(*attrs)`: initializer
    * `get_type_specific_parameters()`: retrieves child-specific extra
      parameters
    * `get_energies()`: retrieves central region Hamiltonian $`\mathbf{H}^{C}`$
    * `get_potential()`: retrieves potential energy values in the central
      region
    * `get_state(n)`: retrieves $`n`$th wavefunction 
    * `get_states()`: retrieves all wavefunctions on the grid
    * `get_number_of_states()`: retrieves the number of states in the central
      region
    * `get_sliced_state(n, width, side)`: retrieves $`n`$th wavefunction on a 
      grid slice
    * `get_sliced_states(width, side)`: retrieves all wavefunctions on a
      grid slice
    * `get_boundary_state(n, side)`: retrieves nth wavefunction evaluated on 
      some boundary
    * `get_coordinate_ranges()`: retrieves x and y coordinate ranges
    * `get_coordinates()`: retrieves the coordinate meshes
    * `get_slice_coordinates(width, side)`: retrieves the sliced
      coordinate meshes
    * `get_boundary_coordinates(side)`: retrieves the boundary coordinate
      range
* `Lead` region:
    * `__init__(*attrs)`: initializer
    * `set_magnetic_field_strength(B)`: sets magnetic field strength
    * `set_energy_spacing(delta_E)`: sets lead energy spacing
    * `get_type_specific_parameters()`: retrieves child-specific extra
      parameters
    * `get_energies()`: retrieves lead region Hamiltonian $`\mathbf{H}^{L}`$
    * `get_state_point(x, y, n)`: evaluates the $`n`$th state wavefunction at
      a single point $`(x, y)`$
    * `get_state(x_points, y_points, n, mode)`: retrieves the $`n`$th
      state wavefunction on a custom/discretized grid
    * `get_number_of_states()`: retrieves the number of states in the lead
      region
    * `get_boundary_state(n, num_boundary_points)`: retrieves $`n`$th wavefunction 
      evaluated on the lead boundary
    * `get_boundary(num_boundary_points)`: retrieves the boundary grid
      with specified discretization
* `Coupling` region:
    * `__init__(Center_object, Lead_object, *attrs)`: initializer, sets the
      center and lead objects ready for the coupling matrix calculations
    * `get_coupling_matrix_element(i, j)`: retrieves coupling matrix element 
     $`\mathbf{V}_{ij}`$, that is, the coupling between $`i`$th lead state and
     $`j`$th central state
    * `get_coupling_matrix()`: retrieves the coupling matrix $`\mathbf{V}`$

Details about the input/output parameter types can be found in the source code.
Upon implementing all of these functions correctly for the corresponding custom
object and extending the parser interface accordingly, the code extension will
be fully consistent with the original code!

## scripts/make_system_files
This script generates custom Hamiltonians or coupling matrices and saves them
in a .npy file to be passed on as arguments for
`CustomCenter`/`CustomLead`/`CustomCoupling` objects. They can also be used to 
generate custom self-energy/rate operators for the wide-band approximation.
Run the script, follow the instructions and the rest is history.

Naturally, these scripts provide only some of the basic functionality 
extensions. Additional scripts/code modifications may be added based on the 
user's end goals.
