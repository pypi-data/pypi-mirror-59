        # topsis-hm
        
        topsis-hm is a Python package for displaying ranking of all criteria using Topsis technique to get good computational efficiency and ability to measure the relative performance for each alternative in a simple mathematical form.
        
        ## Topsis Description
        
        Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is one of the multi-criteria models in making decision which is known for its  simplicity, rationality, comprehensibility and good computational efficiency. Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) refers to making choice of the best alternative from among a finite set of decision alternatives in terms of multiple, usually conflicting criteria.
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        These instructions will help you to install and use this package for general use.
        
        ## Prerequisites
        
        Your csv file should not have categorical data
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.
        
        ```bash
        pip install topsis-hm
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        You can import it either in Python IDLE or run directly through command prompt
        
        ### For Command Prompt
        
        If you want to use this package on "data.csv" file with 4 columns. You need to change the directory where "data.csv" is stored then. Here -w represents weights which signifies weight of each feature or column in our dataset and -i represents impacts which signifies impact of each column or feature in our data. If a feature is good we will use + to denote else we will use -
        
        ```bash
        toposis-hm data.csv -w 1 1 1 1 -i + + - +
        ```
        You can use the following command for help
        
        ```bash
        topsis-hm -h
        ```
        
        ### For Python IDLE
        
        ```python
        from topsis-hm.topsis import top
        top(X,weights,impacts)
        
        #X should be a matrix
        #impacts should be a list of string + for positive impact - for negative impact
        #weights should be a list of int or float
        ```
