**This module is available for backwards compatibility purposes only ([details](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/pull/5540)). It will
no longer be released with the CDK starting March 1st, 2020. See [issue
#5544](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/5544) for upgrade instructions.**

---


This construct library allows you to define [Amazon Elastic Container Service
for Kubernetes (EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) clusters programmatically.
This library also supports programmatically defining Kubernetes resource
manifests within EKS clusters.

This example defines an Amazon EKS cluster with the following configuration:

* 2x **m5.large** instances (this instance type suits most common use-cases, and is good value for money)
* Dedicated VPC with default configuration (see [ec2.Vpc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-ec2-readme.html#vpc))
* A Kubernetes pod with a container based on the [paulbouwer/hello-kubernetes](https://github.com/paulbouwer/hello-kubernetes) image.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
cluster = eks.Cluster(self, "hello-eks")

cluster.add_resource("mypod",
    api_version="v1",
    kind="Pod",
    metadata={"name": "mypod"},
    spec={
        "containers": [{
            "name": "hello",
            "image": "paulbouwer/hello-kubernetes:1.5",
            "ports": [{"container_port": 8080}]
        }
        ]
    }
)
```

Here is a [complete sample](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/blob/master/packages/%40aws-cdk/aws-eks/test/integ.eks-kubectl.lit.ts).

### Capacity

By default, `eks.Cluster` is created with x2 `m5.large` instances.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
eks.Cluster(self, "cluster-two-m5-large")
```

The quantity and instance type for the default capacity can be specified through
the `defaultCapacity` and `defaultCapacityInstance` props:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
eks.Cluster(self, "cluster",
    default_capacity=10,
    default_capacity_instance=ec2.InstanceType("m2.xlarge")
)
```

To disable the default capacity, simply set `defaultCapacity` to `0`:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
eks.Cluster(self, "cluster-with-no-capacity", default_capacity=0)
```

The `cluster.defaultCapacity` property will reference the `AutoScalingGroup`
resource for the default capacity. It will be `undefined` if `defaultCapacity`
is set to `0`:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
cluster = eks.Cluster(self, "my-cluster")
cluster.default_capacity.scale_on_cpu_utilization("up",
    target_utilization_percent=80
)
```

You can add customized capacity through `cluster.addCapacity()` or
`cluster.addAutoScalingGroup()`:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
cluster.add_capacity("frontend-nodes",
    instance_type=ec2.InstanceType("t2.medium"),
    desired_capacity=3,
    vpc_subnets={"subnet_type": ec2.SubnetType.PUBLIC}
)
```

### Spot Capacity

If `spotPrice` is specified, the capacity will be purchased from spot instances:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
cluster.add_capacity("spot",
    spot_price="0.1094",
    instance_type=ec2.InstanceType("t3.large"),
    max_capacity=10
)
```

Spot instance nodes will be labeled with `lifecycle=Ec2Spot` and tainted with `PreferNoSchedule`.

The [Spot Termination Handler](https://github.com/awslabs/ec2-spot-labs/tree/master/ec2-spot-eks-solution/spot-termination-handler)
DaemonSet will be installed on these nodes. The termination handler leverages
[EC2 Spot Instance Termination Notices](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-ec2-spot-instance-termination-notices/)
to gracefully stop all pods running on spot nodes that are about to be
terminated.

### Bootstrapping

When adding capacity, you can specify options for
[/etc/eks/boostrap.sh](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-eks-ami/blob/master/files/bootstrap.sh)
which is responsible for associating the node to the EKS cluster. For example,
you can use `kubeletExtraArgs` to add custom node labels or taints.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
# up to ten spot instances
cluster.add_capacity("spot",
    instance_type=ec2.InstanceType("t3.large"),
    desired_capacity=2,
    bootstrap_options={
        "kubelet_extra_args": "--node-labels foo=bar,goo=far",
        "aws_api_retry_attempts": 5
    }
)
```

To disable bootstrapping altogether (i.e. to fully customize user-data), set `bootstrapEnabled` to `false` when you add
the capacity.

### Masters Role

The Amazon EKS construct library allows you to specify an IAM role that will be
granted `system:masters` privileges on your cluster.

Without specifying a `mastersRole`, you will not be able to interact manually
with the cluster.

The following example defines an IAM role that can be assumed by all users
in the account and shows how to use the `mastersRole` property to map this
role to the Kubernetes `system:masters` group:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
# first define the role
cluster_admin = iam.Role(self, "AdminRole",
    assumed_by=iam.AccountRootPrincipal()
)

# now define the cluster and map role to "masters" RBAC group
eks.Cluster(self, "Cluster",
    masters_role=cluster_admin
)
```

When you `cdk deploy` this CDK app, you will notice that an output will be printed
with the `update-kubeconfig` command.

Something like this:

```
Outputs:
eks-integ-defaults.ClusterConfigCommand43AAE40F = aws eks update-kubeconfig --name cluster-ba7c166b-c4f3-421c-bf8a-6812e4036a33 --role-arn arn:aws:iam::112233445566:role/eks-integ-defaults-Role1ABCC5F0-1EFK2W5ZJD98Y
```

Copy & paste the "`aws eks update-kubeconfig ...`" command to your shell in
order to connect to your EKS cluster with the "masters" role.

Now, given [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) is configured to use AWS
credentials for a user that is trusted by the masters role, you should be able
to interact with your cluster through `kubectl` (the above example will trust
all users in the account).

For example:

```console
$ aws eks update-kubeconfig --name cluster-ba7c166b-c4f3-421c-bf8a-6812e4036a33 --role-arn arn:aws:iam::112233445566:role/eks-integ-defaults-Role1ABCC5F0-1EFK2W5ZJD98Y
Added new context arn:aws:eks:eu-west-2:112233445566:cluster/cluster-ba7c166b-c4f3-421c-bf8a-6812e4036a33 to /Users/boom/.kube/config

```

For your convenience, an AWS CloudFormation output will automatically be
included in your template and will be printed when running `cdk deploy`.

**NOTE**: if the cluster is configured with `kubectlEnabled: false`, it
will be created with the role/user that created the AWS CloudFormation
stack. See [Kubectl Support](#kubectl-support) for details.

### Kubernetes Resources

The `KubernetesResource` construct or `cluster.addResource` method can be used
to apply Kubernetes resource manifests to this cluster.

The following examples will deploy the [paulbouwer/hello-kubernetes](https://github.com/paulbouwer/hello-kubernetes)
service on the cluster:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
app_label = {"app": "hello-kubernetes"}

deployment = {
    "api_version": "apps/v1",
    "kind": "Deployment",
    "metadata": {"name": "hello-kubernetes"},
    "spec": {
        "replicas": 3,
        "selector": {"match_labels": app_label},
        "template": {
            "metadata": {"labels": app_label},
            "spec": {
                "containers": [{
                    "name": "hello-kubernetes",
                    "image": "paulbouwer/hello-kubernetes:1.5",
                    "ports": [{"container_port": 8080}]
                }
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}

service = {
    "api_version": "v1",
    "kind": "Service",
    "metadata": {"name": "hello-kubernetes"},
    "spec": {
        "type": "LoadBalancer",
        "ports": [{"port": 80, "target_port": 8080}],
        "selector": app_label
    }
}

# option 1: use a construct
KubernetesResource(self, "hello-kub",
    cluster=cluster,
    manifest=[deployment, service]
)

# or, option2: use `addResource`
cluster.add_resource("hello-kub", service, deployment)
```

Since Kubernetes resources are implemented as CloudFormation resources in the
CDK. This means that if the resource is deleted from your code (or the stack is
deleted), the next `cdk deploy` will issue a `kubectl delete` command and the
Kubernetes resources will be deleted.

### AWS IAM Mapping

As described in the [Amazon EKS User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/eks/latest/userguide/add-user-role.html),
you can map AWS IAM users and roles to [Kubernetes Role-based access control (RBAC)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac).

The Amazon EKS construct manages the **aws-auth ConfigMap** Kubernetes resource
on your behalf and exposes an API through the `cluster.awsAuth` for mapping
users, roles and accounts.

Furthermore, when auto-scaling capacity is added to the cluster (through
`cluster.addCapacity` or `cluster.addAutoScalingGroup`), the IAM instance role
of the auto-scaling group will be automatically mapped to RBAC so nodes can
connect to the cluster. No manual mapping is required any longer.

> NOTE: `cluster.awsAuth` will throw an error if your cluster is created with `kubectlEnabled: false`.

For example, let's say you want to grant an IAM user administrative privileges
on your cluster:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
admin_user = iam.User(self, "Admin")
cluster.aws_auth.add_user_mapping(admin_user, groups=["system:masters"])
```

A convenience method for mapping a role to the `system:masters` group is also available:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
cluster.aws_auth.add_masters_role(role)
```

### Node ssh Access

If you want to be able to SSH into your worker nodes, you must already
have an SSH key in the region you're connecting to and pass it, and you must
be able to connect to the hosts (meaning they must have a public IP and you
should be allowed to connect to them on port 22):

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
asg = cluster.add_capacity("Nodes",
    instance_type=ec2.InstanceType("t2.medium"),
    vpc_subnets=SubnetSelection(subnet_type=ec2.SubnetType.PUBLIC),
    key_name="my-key-name"
)

# Replace with desired IP
asg.connections.allow_from(ec2.Peer.ipv4("1.2.3.4/32"), ec2.Port.tcp(22))
```

If you want to SSH into nodes in a private subnet, you should set up a
bastion host in a public subnet. That setup is recommended, but is
unfortunately beyond the scope of this documentation.

### kubectl Support

When you create an Amazon EKS cluster, the IAM entity user or role, such as a
[federated user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers.html)
that creates the cluster, is automatically granted `system:masters` permissions
in the cluster's RBAC configuration.

In order to allow programmatically defining **Kubernetes resources** in your AWS
CDK app and provisioning them through AWS CloudFormation, we will need to assume
this "masters" role every time we want to issue `kubectl` operations against your
cluster.

At the moment, the [AWS::EKS::Cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-eks-cluster.html)
AWS CloudFormation resource does not support this behavior, so in order to
support "programmatic kubectl", such as applying manifests
and mapping IAM roles from within your CDK application, the Amazon EKS
construct library uses a custom resource for provisioning the cluster.
This custom resource is executed with an IAM role that we can then use
to issue `kubectl` commands.

The default behavior of this library is to use this custom resource in order
to retain programmatic control over the cluster. In other words: to allow
you to define Kubernetes resources in your CDK code instead of having to
manage your Kubernetes applications through a separate system.

One of the implications of this design is that, by default, the user who
provisioned the AWS CloudFormation stack (executed `cdk deploy`) will
not have administrative privileges on the EKS cluster.

1. Additional resources will be synthesized into your template (the AWS Lambda
   function, the role and policy).
2. As described in [Interacting with Your Cluster](#interacting-with-your-cluster),
   if you wish to be able to manually interact with your cluster, you will need
   to map an IAM role or user to the `system:masters` group. This can be either
   done by specifying a `mastersRole` when the cluster is defined, calling
   `cluster.awsAuth.addMastersRole` or explicitly mapping an IAM role or IAM user to the
   relevant Kubernetes RBAC groups using `cluster.addRoleMapping` and/or
   `cluster.addUserMapping`.

If you wish to disable the programmatic kubectl behavior and use the standard
AWS::EKS::Cluster resource, you can specify `kubectlEnabled: false` when you define
the cluster:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
eks.Cluster(self, "cluster",
    kubectl_enabled=False
)
```

**Take care**: a change in this property will cause the cluster to be destroyed
and a new cluster to be created.

When kubectl is disabled, you should be aware of the following:

1. When you log-in to your cluster, you don't need to specify `--role-arn` as
   long as you are using the same user that created the cluster.
2. As described in the Amazon EKS User Guide, you will need to manually
   edit the [aws-auth ConfigMap](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/add-user-role.html)
   when you add capacity in order to map the IAM instance role to RBAC to allow nodes to join the cluster.
3. Any `eks.Cluster` APIs that depend on programmatic kubectl support will fail
   with an error: `cluster.addResource`, `cluster.addChart`, `cluster.awsAuth`, `props.mastersRole`.

### Helm Charts

The `HelmChart` construct or `cluster.addChart` method can be used
to add Kubernetes resources to this cluster using Helm.

The following example will install the [NGINX Ingress Controller](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/)
to you cluster using Helm.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
# option 1: use a construct
HelmChart(self, "NginxIngress",
    cluster=cluster,
    chart="nginx-ingress",
    repository="https://helm.nginx.com/stable",
    namespace="kube-system"
)

# or, option2: use `addChart`
cluster.add_chart("NginxIngress",
    chart="nginx-ingress",
    repository="https://helm.nginx.com/stable",
    namespace="kube-system"
)
```

Helm charts will be installed and updated using `helm upgrade --install`.
This means that if the chart is added to CDK with the same release name, it will try to update
the chart in the cluster. The chart will exists as CloudFormation resource.

Helm charts are implemented as CloudFormation resources in CDK.
This means that if the chart is deleted from your code (or the stack is
deleted), the next `cdk deploy` will issue a `helm uninstall` command and the
Helm chart will be deleted.

When there is no `release` defined, the chart will be installed using the `node.uniqueId`,
which will be lower cassed and truncated to the last 63 characters.
