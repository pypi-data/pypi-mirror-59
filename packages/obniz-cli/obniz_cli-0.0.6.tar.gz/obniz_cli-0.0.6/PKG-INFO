Description: # obniz_cli
        `obniz_cli` is cli tool for obnizOS(for ESP32) install.
        
        ## Installation
        Using pip,
        ```
        pip install obniz_cli
        ```
        
        ## Preparation
        Connect the ESP32 device from the serial port to your PC and check if the PC recognizes the device. The following command shows the list of devices.
        ```
        python -m serial.tools.list_ports
        ```
        (You can execute this command after `pip install obniz_cli`.)  
        In most cases, port name is `dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART` or like `COM3`. If you can't find these port or can find but fail to install, you may need USB-driver for devices from [here](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers).
        
        ## Usage
        ### flashos
        ```
        obniz_cli flashos [-b] [-p]
        ```
        You can install obnizOS to your ESP32 device. If you execute without `-p` option, it is displayed as follows:
        ```
        0: /dev/cu.Bluetooth-Incoming-Port
        1: /dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART
        
        Select NUMBER from above list(or if you want to cancel, input N key):
        ```
        Select the device you want to install. (A device port can be passed to command with `-p` option like `obniz_cli flashos -p /dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART`).  
        
        Then, latest obnizOS is downloaded and installed to device. By default, installation is performed at 115200bps but if installation failed, try to decrease it by `obniz_cli flashos -b 115200`.
        
        After install, cli automatically change serial mode to set obnizOS configuration 
        
        ### eraseos
        ```
        obniz_cli eraseos [-p]
        ```
        You can reset your device by this command.
