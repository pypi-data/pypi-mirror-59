forester
~~~~~~~~

Helpful scripts for the shell. These scripts were created for linux server maintenance,
filling small gaps left by the standard tools.

All scripts are written in pure Python and are platform-independent. So you can also
use them on Windows or Mac.

========
Offers commands to:

* Summarize the size and latest changes of folders in a directory tree
* List how much space the subfolders in a directory tree take when considering hardlinks between them

Pure Python. No dependencies - just the standard library.


Usage
=====

forester info
-------------

This command gets you an overview of folder contents. It shows the number of files and folders within each subfolder
as well as the newest modification time of any file within the subfolder.

.. code-block:: console

    $ forester info --max-depth=1 /usr
    Scanned 7909 folders

directory.

There are two measures shown for each folder:

 - Total size: This is the total size of all files within the folder as it is also
   returned by `du`.
 - Size of unique inodes: This is the size of the inodes which are only linked into
   this folder. This excludes all files which are also hardlinked to one of the other
   listed folders. When deleting a folder this is the space which would be gained.

This command was created to measure how much space is taken by each snapshot within a folder
with incremental backups created by `rsync`.
Each folder contains hardlinks to the previous backups for unchanged files. With
`forester contribs` one can see how much space is exclusively taken by one of the
snapshots.
