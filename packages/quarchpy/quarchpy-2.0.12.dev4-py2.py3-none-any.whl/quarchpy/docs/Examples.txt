Application note - 006 - Python Controls Examples
Application note demonstrating python control of quarch modules. This application note was written to be used in conjunction with QuarchPy python package and Quarch modules.


https://quarch.com/system/files/asset_files/AN-012-07%20-%20QIS%20Python%20USB%20control%20of%20Power%20Modules%201.7.zip
Application note - 012 - QisListDevices
Application note demonstrating control of power modules via QIS. This example checks everything is working by connecting to QIS and listing the devices
available for connection.  This verifies QuarchPy, QIS and the connection to the module(s)

Applicaiton note - 012 - QisMultiStreamExample
Application note demonstrating control of power modules via QIS. This example demonstrates the ability of the module to run multiple streams in a row.
This might be used when several work loads are being run on a drive, and each is to be logged seperately

Applicaiton note - 012 - QisStreamExample
Application note demonstrating control of power modules via QIS. This example demonstrates several different control actions on power modules
Examples include sending commands and recording to file

Application note - 012 - QisStreamx6Example
Application note demonstrating control of power modules via QIS
This example connects to all 6 ports of the QTL1995 and streams from them at the same time.
Data is saved to file(s) with each module being saved into a different file.  A file size limit forces data to be stored into multiple smaller files.

Application note - 016 - IOMETER Script
This example uses IOMeter and QPS to run traffic tests to a drive, with the power and performance data displayed.
- The user is prompted to select an IOmeter target (Physical disk or drive letter)
- The .conf files are IOmeter templates which are then turned into .icf files with the selected target in place
- IOmeter is invoked over each .icf file in the folder whild QPS is used to display combined power and performance data

Applicaiton note - 017 - FIO Script
This example uses FIO and QPS to run traffic tests to a drive, with the power and performance data displayed.
- The user is prompted to select a target (mapped drive location)
- FIO is invoked to run a workload to the selected location.  Power and IO performance data is logged and displayed in QPS
