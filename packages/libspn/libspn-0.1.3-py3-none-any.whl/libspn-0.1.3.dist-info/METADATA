# LibSPN

LibSPN is a library for learning and inference with Sum-Product Networks. LibSPN
is integrated with [TensorFlow](http://www.tensorflow.org).

## What are SPNs?

Sum-Product Networks (SPNs) are a probabilistic deep architecture with solid theoretical foundations, which demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in several domains. Yet, surprisingly, there are no mature, general-purpose SPN implementations that would serve as a platform for the community of machine learning researchers centered around SPNs. LibSPN is a new general-purpose Python library, which aims to become such a platform. The library is designed to make it straightforward and effortless to apply various SPN architectures to large-scale datasets and problems. The library achieves scalability and efficiency, thanks to a tight coupling with TensorFlow, a framework already used by a large community of researchers and developers in multiple domains.


## Why LibSPN?

Several reasons:


* LibSPN is a general-purpose library with a generic interface and tools for generating SPN structure, making it easy to apply SPNs to any domain/problem
* LibSPN offers a simple Python interface for building or generating networks, learning, and inference, facilitating prototyping (e.g. in Jupyter) and enabling simple integration of SPNs with other software
* LibSPN is integrated with TensorFlow, making it possible to combine SPNs with other deep learning methods
* LibSPN uses concepts that should sound familiar to TensorFlow users (e.g. tensors, variables, feeding, queues, batching, TensorBoard etc.)
* LibSPN leverages the power of TensorFlow to efficiently perform parallel computations on (multiple) GPU devices
* LibSPN is extendable, making it easy to add custom operations and graph nodes

## Installation

### Prerequisites
LibSPN requires installing `tensorflow` and `tensorflow-probability` first. The table below shows
which version of each you'd need if you want to be specific:

| `tensorflow`  | `tensorflow-probability` |
|:-------------:|:------------------------:|
|      1.14     |           0.7.0          |
|      1.13     |           0.6.0          |
|      1.12     |           0.5.0          |
|      1.11     |           0.4.0          |

First, install `tensorflow` or `tensorflow-gpu`:
```bash
pip install tensorflow-gpu
```
Then, install `tensorflow-probability`:
```bash
pip install tensorflow-probability
```

### LibSPN
LibSPN is also available on `pypi`:
```bash
pip install libspn
```
