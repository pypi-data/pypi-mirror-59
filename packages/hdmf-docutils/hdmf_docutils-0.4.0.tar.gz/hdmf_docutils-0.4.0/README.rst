History
-------

nwb-docutils was renamed to hdmf-docutils and generalized to be (mostly) independent of NWB in January, 2020.

nwb-docutils was initially a sub-directory of the nwb-schema project. Corresponding history was extracted during
the `4th NWB Hackathon <https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/nwb_hackathons/HCK04_2018_Seattle/>`_ into a
dedicated *pip-installable* project to facilitate its use by both core NWB documentation projects and various
NWB extensions.
