class LocalScaling(HubnessReduction):
    """ Hubness reduction with Local Scaling [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    k: int, default = 5
        Number of neighbors to consider for the rescaling

    method: 'standard' or 'nicdm', default = 'standard'
        Perform local scaling with the specified variant:

        - 'standard' or 'ls' rescale distances using the distance to the k-th neighbor
        - 'nicdm' rescales distances using a statistic over distances to k neighbors

    verbose: int, default = 0
        If verbose > 0, show progress bar.
