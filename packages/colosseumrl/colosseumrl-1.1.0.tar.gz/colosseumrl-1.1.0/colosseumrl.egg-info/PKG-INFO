Description: ## Codebase for the UCI multi agent reinforcement learning framework
        
        A framework for developing large multiplayer reinforcement learning agents that can play free-for-all games. Currently available games are:
        
        - Tron: A simple snake-like game where the goal is not to crash into the walls.
        - Blokus: A board game of controlling territory with various shaped blocks.
        - Tic Tac Toe: Generalization of tic tac toe to 2, 3, and 4 players.
        
        
        ## Requirements
        This library requires at least Python 3.6 in order to run correctly.
        Python 2.7 is not currently supported.
        
        
        Basic requirements are listed in the `requirements.txt` and can be installed from PyPi with
        `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
        
        ## Install
        Simply run `pip install colosseumrl` in order to install the latest stable version from Pypi.
        
        ## Important scripts
        `python3 -m colosseumrl.matchmaking.MatchmakingServer` launches the main matchmaking
        server for allowing any number of agents to play against each other in a dynamic
        way. Run `python -m rlcompetition.matchmaking.MatchmakingServer -h` for
        more information. 
        
        `./colosseumrl/examples` contains a list of example scripts that will connect
        to a matchmaking server and launch an example agent.
