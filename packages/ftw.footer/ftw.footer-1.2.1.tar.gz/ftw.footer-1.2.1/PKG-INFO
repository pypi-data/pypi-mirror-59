Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        ``ftw.footer`` provides a viewlet, which shows 1 - 4 contextual portlet columns.
        
        Compatibility
        -------------
        
        - Plone 4.3.x
        - Plone 5.1.x
        
        Plone 5 notes
        -------------
        
        - Since Plone 5 provides the means to edit any portlet manager through the
          Manage portlets menu item, we've taken the step to disable the manage-footer
          view from Plone 5 onwards.  (It also didn't work well on small screens).
        
        - Plone 5's (default) Barceloneta theme automatically distributes the portlet
          managers from this product across the footer.  This is usually OK, but if it
          does not suit your requirements, then you should use a different theme.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        
        - Add ``ftw.footer`` to your buildout configuration:
        
        ::
        
            [instance]
            eggs +=
                ftw.footer
        
        - Run `bin/buildout`
        
        - Install the generic import profile.
        
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        The amount of portlet columns in the footer can be configured in the
        `portal_registry` option `IFooterSettings.columns_count`.
        
        Up to four columns are currently supported.
