        # Time Series Feature Extraction Library
        ## Intuitive time series feature extraction
        This repository hosts the **TSFEL - Time Series Feature Extraction Library** python package. TSFEL assists researchers on exploratory feature extraction tasks on time series without requiring significant programming effort.
        
        Users can interact with TSFEL using two methods:
        ##### Online
        It does not requires installation as it relies on Google Colabs and a user interface provided by Google Sheets
        
        ##### Offline
        Advanced users can take full potential of TSFEL by installing as a python package
        ```python
        pip install tsfel
        ```
        
        ## Includes a comprehensive number of features
        TSFEL is optimized for time series and **automatically extracts over 60 different features on the statistical, temporal and spectral domains.**
        
        ## Functionalities
        * **Intuitive, fast deployment and reproducible**: interactive UI for feature selection and customization
        * **Computational complexity evaluation**: estimate the computational effort before extracting features
        * **Comprehensive documentation**: each feature extraction method has a detailed explanation
        * **Unit tested**: we provide unit tests for each feature
        * **Easily extended**: adding new features is easy and we encourage you to contribute with your custom features
        
        ## Get started
        The code below extracts all the available features on an example dataset file.
        
        ```python
        import tsfel
        import pandas as pd
        
        # load dataset
        df = pd.read_csv('Dataset.txt')
        
        # Retrieves a pre-defined feature configuration file to extract all available features
        cfg = tsfel.get_features_by_domain()
        
        # Extract features
        X = tsfel.time_series_features_extractor(cfg, df)
        ```
