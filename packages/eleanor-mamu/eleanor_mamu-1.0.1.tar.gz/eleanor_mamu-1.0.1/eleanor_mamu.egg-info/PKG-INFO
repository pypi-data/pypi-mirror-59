Description: 
        eleanor is a python package to extract target pixel files from
        TESS Full Frame Images and produce systematics-corrected light curves
        for any star observed by the TESS mission. In its simplest form, eleanor
        takes a TIC ID, a Gaia source ID, or (RA, Dec) coordinates of a star
        observed by TESS and returns, as a single object, a light curve and
        accompanying target pixel data.
