# BxModels

BxModels provides a repository for well-known machine learning models
implemented in PyTorch. With the help of PyTorch, these models can benefit from
strong GPU acceleration.

BxModels is built on top of BxTorch, a library which enables developers to
handle PyTorch models even more easily and providing multiple means of speeding
up training.

## Installation

BxModels is available on PyPi, so simply run the following command:

```bash
pip install bxmodels
```
