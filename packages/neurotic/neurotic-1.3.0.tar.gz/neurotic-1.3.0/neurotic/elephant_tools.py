def _butter(signal, highpass_freq=None, lowpass_freq=None, order=4,

    """
    Butterworth filtering function for neo.AnalogSignal. Filter type is
    determined according to how values of `highpass_freq` and `lowpass_freq`
    are given (see Parameters section for details).

    Parameters
    ----------
    signal : AnalogSignal or Quantity array or NumPy ndarray
        Time series data to be filtered. When given as Quantity array or NumPy
        ndarray, the sampling frequency should be given through the keyword
        argument `fs`.
    highpass_freq, lowpass_freq : Quantity or float
        High-pass and low-pass cut-off frequencies, respectively. When given as
        float, the given value is taken as frequency in Hz.
        Filter type is determined depending on values of these arguments:
            * highpass_freq only (lowpass_freq = None):    highpass filter
            * lowpass_freq only (highpass_freq = None):    lowpass filter
            * highpass_freq < lowpass_freq:    bandpass filter
            * highpass_freq > lowpass_freq:    bandstop filter
    order : int
        Order of Butterworth filter. Default is 4.
    filter_function : string
        Filtering function to be used. Available filters:
            * 'filtfilt': `scipy.signal.filtfilt()`;
            * 'lfilter': `scipy.signal.lfilter()`;
            * 'sosfiltfilt': `scipy.signal.sosfiltfilt()`.
        In most applications 'filtfilt' should be used, because it doesn't
        bring about phase shift due to filtering. For numerically stable
        filtering, in particular higher order filters, use 'sosfiltfilt'
        (see issue
        https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/elephant/issues/220).
        Default is 'filtfilt'.
    fs : Quantity or float
        The sampling frequency of the input time series. When given as float,
        its value is taken as frequency in Hz. When the input is given as neo
        AnalogSignal, its attribute is used to specify the sampling
        frequency and this parameter is ignored. Default is 1.0.
    axis : int
        Axis along which filter is applied. Default is -1.

    Returns
    -------
    filtered_signal : AnalogSignal or Quantity array or NumPy ndarray
        Filtered input data. The shape and type is identical to those of the
        input.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `filter_function` is not one of 'lfilter', 'filtfilt',
        or 'sosfiltfilt'.
        When both `highpass_freq` and `lowpass_freq` are None.

def _rauc(signal, baseline=None, bin_duration=None, t_start=None, t_stop=None):
    '''
    Calculate the rectified area under the curve (RAUC) for an AnalogSignal.

    The signal is optionally divided into bins with duration `bin_duration`,
    and the rectified signal (absolute value) is integrated within each bin to
    find the area under the curve. The mean or median of the signal or an
    arbitrary baseline may optionally be subtracted before rectification. If
    the number of bins is 1 (default), a single value is returned for each
    channel in the input signal. Otherwise, an AnalogSignal containing the
    values for each bin is returned along with the times of the centers of the
    bins.

    Parameters
    ----------
    signal : neo.AnalogSignal
        The signal to integrate. If `signal` contains more than one channel,
        each is integrated separately.
    bin_duration : quantities.Quantity
        The length of time that each integration should span. If None, there
        will be only one bin spanning the entire signal duration. If
        `bin_duration` does not divide evenly into the signal duration, the end
        of the signal is padded with zeros to accomodate the final,
        overextending bin.
        Default: None
    baseline : string or quantities.Quantity
        A factor to subtract from the signal before rectification. If `'mean'`
        or `'median'`, the mean or median value of the entire signal is
        subtracted on a channel-by-channel basis.
        Default: None
    t_start, t_stop : quantities.Quantity
        Times to start and end the algorithm. The signal is cropped using
        `signal.time_slice(t_start, t_stop)` after baseline removal. Useful if
        you want the RAUC for a short section of the signal but want the
        mean or median calculation (`baseline='mean'` or `baseline='median'`)
        to use the entire signal for better baseline estimation.
        Default: None

    Returns
    -------
    quantities.Quantity or neo.AnalogSignal
        If the number of bins is 1, the returned object is a scalar or
        vector Quantity containing a single RAUC value for each channel.
        Otherwise, the returned object is an AnalogSignal containing the
        RAUC(s) for each bin stored as a sample, with times corresponding to
        the center of each bin. The output signal will have the same number
        of channels as the input signal.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If the input signal is not a neo.AnalogSignal.
    TypeError
        If `bin_duration` is not None or a Quantity.
