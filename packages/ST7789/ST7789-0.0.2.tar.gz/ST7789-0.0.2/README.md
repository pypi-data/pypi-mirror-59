Python library to control an ST7789 TFT LCD display

Designed specifically to work with a ST7789 based 240x240 pixel TFT SPI display. (Specifically the 1.3" SPI LCD from Pimoroni).

Make sure you have the following dependencies:

````
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-rpi.gpio python-spidev python-pip python-pil python-numpy
````

Install this library by running:

````
sudo pip install st7789
````

See example of usage in the examples folder.


# Licensing & History

This library is a modification of a modification of code originally written by Tony DiCola for Adafruit Industries, and modified to work with the ST7735 by Clement Skau.

To create this ST7789 driver, it has been hard-forked from st7735-python which was originally modified by Pimoroni to include support for their 160x80 SPI LCD breakout.

## Modifications include:

* PIL/Pillow has been removed from the underlying display driver to separate concerns- you should create your own PIL image and display it using `display(image)`
* `width`, `height`, `rotation`, `invert`, `offset_left` and `offset_top` parameters can be passed into `__init__` for alternate displays
* `Adafruit_GPIO` has been replaced with `RPi.GPIO` and `spidev` to closely align with our other software (IE: Raspberry Pi only)
* Test fixtures have been added to keep this library stable
