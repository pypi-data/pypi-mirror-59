**Channel ID**: ``blueset.fbmessenger``

EFMS is a channel that connects to Facebook Messenger for EH Forwarder
Bot, based on simulation of Facebook Messenger Web, and
`fbchat <https://github.com/carpedm20/fbchat>`_.

Beta version
-------------

This is an unstable beta version, and its functionality may change at any
time.

Requirements
------------

-  Python >= 3.6
-  EH Forwarder Bot >= 2.0.0

Getting started
---------------

1. Install required binary dependencies
2. Install

   .. code:: shell

       pip3 install efb-fb-messenger-slave

3. Enable and configure EFMS using the *EFB configuration wizard*, or enable
   it manually in the profileâ€™s ``config.yaml``.

   The path to the current profile may vary depends on your
   configuration.

   **(In EFB 2, the default profile path is**
   ``~/.ehforwarderbot/profiles/default`` **)**

4. Sign in (only if setting up manually)

   .. code:: shell

       $ efms-auth

   And follow the instructions.

Known issues
------------
- Messages from threads in ``MARKETPLACE`` type (i.e. messages from interested
  buyers on Facebook Marketplace) cannot be processed.
- Live location cannot be updated properly.
- Poll messages, reminders and events are not yet supported.
- Voice calls are not planned to be supported.

Optional configuration file
---------------------------

EFMS allows user to enable or disable experimental features with the
configuration file. It is located at
``<Path to current profile>/blueset.fbmessenger/config.yaml``.

Example
~~~~~~~

.. code:: yaml

    # Experimental flags
    # This section can be used to enable experimental functionality.
    # However, those features may be changed or removed at any time.
    # Options in this section is explained afterward.
    flags:
        option_one: 10
        option_two: false
        option_three: "foobar"

Tips and tricks
---------------

-  To send large emoji, send the emoji as text following by ``S``,
   ``M``, or ``L`` as small, medium and large emoji accordingly.
   For example, to send a large smile emoji, send ``ðŸ˜†L``.

Experimental flags
------------------

The following flags are experimental features, may change, break, or
disappear at any time. Use at your own risk.

-  ``proxy_links_by_facebook`` *(bool)* [Default: ``false``]

   Deliver links (including links in share entities and thumbnails)
   using Facebookâ€™s proxy. Disable this option to show the source
   directly.

-  ``send_link_with_description`` *(bool)* [Default: ``false``]

   When processing link message from the Master Channel, attach the
   title and description besides the link when the option is enabled.

   .. note::
        Regardless of this option, link messages are sent as text, and
        Facebook Messenger may or may not attach its own link preview per its
        system configuration.*

-  ``show_pending_threads`` *(bool)* [Default: ``false``]

   When showing the threads list, include threads pending approval.

-  ``show_archived_threads`` *(bool)* [Default: ``false``]

   When showing the threads list, include archived threads.

Vendor-specifics
----------------

EFMSâ€™s chats provides the following vendor specific options:

* ``'chat_type'`` *(str)*: Type of the thread: ``'User'``, ``'Page'``, or
  ``'Group'``.
* ``'profile_picture_url'`` *(str)*: URL to the threadâ€™s
  profile picture.
