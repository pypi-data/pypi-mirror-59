# What's that thing?

`lb-controller` is kubernetes operator that can handle dynamic reconfiguration
of an external load balancer, *e.g* haproxy, it aims to allow the use of the
`LoadBalancer` or `NodePort` service type with on premise clusters.

This operator is not deployed in the K8s cluster but on the load balancers and
is a subscriber of the cluster events to know when it has to wake up and do its
thing.

We thought of 3 scenarios while building this app:

  - HAProxy + keepalived
  - Envoy + keepalived
  - keepalived only

The advantage of this implementation compared to [MetalLB](https://metallb.universe.tf/)
is that you gain the ability to completely master the LB configuration, for
example ipv6 to ipv4 or specific SSL configurations.

LB-controller doesn't allocate IP addresses for LB. They must be specified:
  - for *LoadBalancer* services, using `spec.loadBalancerIP` field
  - for *NodePort* services, using an annotation nammed `external-lb/ip-address`

# How should I integrate `lb-controller`?

* Install haproxy and keepalived
* pip install lb-controller
* add the configurations in /etc/lb-controller/
* Define a dedicated service account to consume only the appropriate resources
  from the cluster API server
* set this identity in the `/root/.kube/config` file on the HAProxy hosts.

You can find an ansible role at this address... as an example.

# Metrics

This app exposes two metrics in the openmetrics format to be scrape by
prometheus for example:
- number of valid managed services
- number of invalid managed services
