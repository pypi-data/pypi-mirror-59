Description: jk_asyncio_logging
        ==========
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        This python module ...
        
        Information about this module can be found here:
        
        * [github.org](https://github.com/jkpubsrc/....)
        * [pypi.python.org](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jk_asyncio_logging)
        
        Why this module?
        ----------------
        
        With `jk_logging` there is a logging module available that allows constructing loggers from a JSON based description, offers buffers for log messages and supports hierarchical logging. Unfortunately this particular module is synchroneous and therefore can not be used in `Asyncio` directly. This implementation therefore wraps `jk_logging` and provides an API usable in `Asyncio`.
        
        Limitations of this module
        --------------------------
        
        This module provides classes wrapping (almost all) classes from `jk_logging`. It provides almost all functionality despite one: Descending hierarchically is not supported. (This might change one day, but not in the near future.)
        
        How to install module
        ----------------------
        
        This module can be installed easily using `pip`.
        
        Use this command for a system wide installation of this module:
        
        ```bash
        $ sudo pip install jk-asyncio-logging
        ```
        
        Use this command for user specific installation of this module:
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install --user jk-asyncio-logging
        ```
        
        The PiPy module is always kept in sync with the Github repository so using PyPi is equivalent to a manual installation using the code provided on Github.
        
        How to use this module
        ----------------------
        
        ### Import this module
        
        Please include this module into your application using the following code:
        
        ```python
        import jk_asyncio_logging
        ```
        
        ### Construct a logger
        
        Example:
        
        ```python
        log = jk_asyncio_logging.AsyncioConsoleLogger.create(logMsgFormatter=jk_asyncio_logging.COLOR_LOG_MESSAGE_FORMATTER)
        ```
        
        Here we construct a console logger (which is an object that writes log messages to STDOUT.) It is configured for using colors for all output here.
        
        ### Use the logger
        
        You can create text based log messages and write them to the logger. Example:
        
        ```python
        await log.debug("This is a test for DEBUG.")
        await log.notice("This is a test for NOTICE.")
        await log.info("This is a test for INFO.")
        await log.warning("This is a test for WARNING.")
        await log.error("This is a test for ERROR.")
        ```
        
        Exceptions can be logged as well. Example:
        
        ```python
        try:
        	await log.notice("Let's try a calculation that will fail ...")
        	a = 0
        	b = 5 / a
        except Exception as ee:
        	await log.error(ee)
        ```
        
        What kind of log objects are available?
        ---------------------------------------
        
        You can make use of the following log objects:
        
        * `AsyncioBufferLogger` - implements a buffer for log messages, which later on can be forwareded to another logger
        * `AsyncioConsoleLogger` - implements writing to STDOUT
        * `AsyncioFileLogger` - implements writing to a file
        * `AsyncioFilterLogger` - implements filtering of log messages according to log level
        * `AsyncioMulticastLogger` - implements forwarding log messages to multiple loggers
        * `AsyncioNamedMulticastLogger` - implements forwarding log messages to multiple loggers
        * `AsyncioNullLogger` - discards all log messages
        * `AsyncioStringListLogger` - implements a buffer for log messages, where all log messages are stored a plain text strings

        See the `test` directory for detailed examples of all loggers.
