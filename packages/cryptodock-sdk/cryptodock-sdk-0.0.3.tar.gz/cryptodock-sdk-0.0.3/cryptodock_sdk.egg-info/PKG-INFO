Description: # CryptoDock Python SDK
        
        CryptoDock SDK is a Python package used alongside the CryptoDock desktop iOS app, the CryptoDock remote API, and the CryptoDock remote Backtesters.
        
        When bootstrapping a trading strategy in the CryptoDock desktop app the SDK is copied into the target local directory for your use in strategy development. It communicates with the remote API to pull historic and current trading data from multiple exchanges.
        
        Using this method we can normalize the structures of data from across the exchanges, and provide a semantic interface, allowing for a much more efficient strategy development and research process.
        
        The remote Backtesters also use the SDK for their Backtesting in order to maintain consistency in data structures between the local strategy development and backtesting environment.
        
        ## Installation
        
        To install the SDK run: `pip install cryptodock-sdk`, or `pip install cryptodock-sdk==0.0.1`
        
        This package will not work unless used alongside CryptoDock.
