        Usage
        -----
        
        ::
        
           # pip install git+https://github.com/steven2K19/fundamental
           # or simply download the py file in your folder
        
           from fundamental import get_df_list
        
           symlist=['GOOG','MSFT','FB'] 
           df = get_df_list(symlist)        
        
        Limitation
        ----------
        
        -  It takes about 10 minutes to create dataframe for 100 stocks.
        -  Few tickers cannot be scraped by yfinance.
        -  slow internet connection would lead scraping error and the program
           will auto try 3 times.
