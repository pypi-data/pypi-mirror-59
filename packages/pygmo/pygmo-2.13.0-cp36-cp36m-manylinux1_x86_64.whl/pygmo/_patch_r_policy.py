def _r_policy_extract(self, t):
    """Extract the user-defined replacement policy.

    This method allows to extract a reference to the user-defined replacement policy (UDRP) stored within this
    :class:`~pygmo.r_policy` instance. The behaviour of this function depends on the value
    of *t* (which must be a :class:`type`) and on the type of the internal UDRP:

    * if the type of the UDRP is *t*, then a reference to the UDRP will be returned
      (this mirrors the behaviour of the corresponding C++ method
      :cpp:func:`pagmo::r_policy::extract()`),
    * if *t* is :class:`object` and the UDRP is a Python object (as opposed to an
      :ref:`exposed C++ replacement policy <py_r_policies_cpp>`), then a reference to the
      UDRP will be returned (this allows to extract a Python UDRP without knowing its type),
    * otherwise, :data:`None` will be returned.

    Args:
        t (:class:`type`): the type of the user-defined replacement policy to extract

    Returns:
        a reference to the internal user-defined replacement policy, or :data:`None` if the extraction fails

    Raises:
        TypeError: if *t* is not a :class:`type`

    This method returns :data:`False` if :func:`extract(t) <pygmo.r_policy.extract>` returns
    :data:`None`, and :data:`True` otherwise.

    Args:
        t (:class:`type`): the type that will be compared to the type of the UDRP
