def _topology_extract(self, t):
    """Extract the user-defined topology.

    This method allows to extract a reference to the user-defined topology (UDT) stored within this
    :class:`~pygmo.topology` instance. The behaviour of this function depends on the value
    of *t* (which must be a :class:`type`) and on the type of the internal UDT:

    * if the type of the UDT is *t*, then a reference to the UDT will be returned
      (this mirrors the behaviour of the corresponding C++ method
      :cpp:func:`pagmo::topology::extract()`),
    * if *t* is :class:`object` and the UDT is a Python object (as opposed to an
      :ref:`exposed C++ topology <py_topologies_cpp>`), then a reference to the
      UDT will be returned (this allows to extract a Python UDT without knowing its type),
    * otherwise, :data:`None` will be returned.

    Args:
        t (:class:`type`): the type of the user-defined topology to extract

    Returns:
        a reference to the internal user-defined topology, or :data:`None` if the extraction fails

    Raises:
        TypeError: if *t* is not a :class:`type`

    Examples:
        >>> import pygmo as pg
        >>> t1 = pg.topology(pg.ring())
        >>> t1.extract(pg.ring) # doctest: +SKIP
        <pygmo.core.ring at 0x7f8e4792b670>
        >>> t1.extract(pg.unconnected) is None

        ...         return [[], []]
        ...     def push_back(self):
        ...         return
        >>> t2 = pg.topology(topo())
