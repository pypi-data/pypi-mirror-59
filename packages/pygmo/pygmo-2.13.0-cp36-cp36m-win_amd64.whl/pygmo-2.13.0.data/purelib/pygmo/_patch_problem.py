def _problem_extract(self, t):
    """Extract the user-defined problem.

    This method allows to extract a reference to the user-defined problem (UDP) stored within this
    :class:`~pygmo.problem` instance. The behaviour of this function depends on the value
    of *t* (which must be a :class:`type`) and on the type of the internal UDP:

    * if the type of the UDP is *t*, then a reference to the UDP will be returned
      (this mirrors the behaviour of the corresponding C++ method
      :cpp:func:`pagmo::problem::extract()`),
    * if *t* is :class:`object` and the UDP is a Python object (as opposed to an
      :ref:`exposed C++ problem <py_problems_cpp>`), then a reference to the
      UDP will be returned (this allows to extract a Python UDP without knowing its type),
    * otherwise, :data:`None` will be returned.

    Args:
        t (:class:`type`): the type of the user-defined problem to extract

    Returns:
        a reference to the internal user-defined problem, or :data:`None` if the extraction fails

    Raises:
        TypeError: if *t* is not a :class:`type`

    Examples:
        >>> import pygmo as pg
        >>> p1 = pg.problem(pg.rosenbrock())
        >>> p1.extract(pg.rosenbrock) # doctest: +SKIP
        <pygmo.core.rosenbrock at 0x7f56b870fd50>
        >>> p1.extract(pg.ackley) is None
        True
        >>> class prob:
        ...     def fitness(self, x):
        ...         return [x[0]]
        ...     def get_bounds(self):
        ...         return ([0],[1])
        >>> p2 = pg.problem(prob())
        >>> p2.extract(object) # doctest: +SKIP
        <__main__.prob at 0x7f56a66b6588>
        >>> p2.extract(prob) # doctest: +SKIP
        <__main__.prob at 0x7f56a66b6588>
        >>> p2.extract(pg.rosenbrock) is None
