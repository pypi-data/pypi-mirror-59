        ## Installation
        
        Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install topsis-3606.
        
        ```bash
        pip install TOPSIS-3606
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        The TOPSIS technique is helpful for decision makers to structure the problems to be solved, conduct analyses, comparisons and ranking of the alternatives. The classical TOPSIS method solves problems in which all decision data are known and represented by crisp numbers.
        
        Following line of code will get you the desired ranking for your dataset.
        
        ```python
        TOPSIS-3606 PhotogenicFace.csv [1,1,1,1,1] [+,-,+,+,+]
        ```
        
        ## Examplar Dataset
        
        ### PhotogenicFace.csv
        
        | ID | EYES | NOSE | FOREHEAD | LIPS  | CHIN |
        |----|------|------|----------|-------|------|
        | S1 | 0.79 | 0.62 | 1.25     | 60.89 | 11   |
        | S2 | 0.66 | 0.44 | 2.89     | 63.07 | 20   |
        | S3 | 0.56 | 0.31 | 1.57     | 62.87 | 16   |
        | S4 | 0.82 | 0.67 | 2.68     | 70.19 | 16   |
        | S5 | 0.75 | 0.56 | 1.3      | 80.39 | 20   |
        
        ### Input
        
        ```python
        TOPSIS-3606 PhotogenicFace.csv [1,1,1,1,1] [+,-,+,+,+]
        ```
        Weights = [1,1,1,1,1]
        
        Impacts = [+,-,+,+,+]
        
        ### Result / Output
        
        ```bash
        Topsis Selection of DATA
        
        Models     | Rank
        ------------------
