"""PyAMS_utils.factory module

This module provides a decorator and a small set of functions to handle object factories.

Instead of directly using a class as an object factory, the object of this module is to
let you create an object based on an interface. The first step is to create an object
implementing this interface, and then to register it as a factory:

.. code-block:: python

    @implementer(IMyInterface)
    class MyClass(object):
        '''Class implementing my interface'''

    register_factory(IMyInterface, MyClass)

Factory registry can also be handle by a decorator called "factory_config":

.. code-block:: python

    @factory_config(IMyInterface)
    class MyClass(object):
        '''Class implementing my interface'''

A class declared as factory for a specific interface automatically implements the given interface.
You can also provide a tuple or set of interfaces in "factory_config()" decorator.

When a factory is registered, you can look for a factory:

.. code-block:: python

    factory = get_object_factory(IMyInterface)
    if factory is not None:
        myobject = factory()
    else:
        myobject = MyDefaultImplementation()

By registering their own objects factories, extension packages can easily provide their
own implementation of any PyAMS interface handled by factories.
