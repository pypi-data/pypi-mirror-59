Description: # Correspondence_tables
        This is a work space for the correspondence tables working group for BONSAI
        
        ## Background
        BONSAI will draw data from multiple sources, e.g. national supply-use tables, statistical databases etc. These have their own native classification to define products, activities, elementary flows or, generally speaking,  objects/activity flows.
        
        The integration of these data requires correspondence tables. These establish a correspondence between the different classifications of flow-objects, activities and properties. These correspondance tables are sometimes available from data providers (e.g [UN Stats](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/trade/classifications/correspondence-tables.asp)). In other cases the correspondance tables are created by the group.

        ## Goals and objectives  
        The goal of this working group is to collect, validate and classify correspondence tables between existing classifications and to convert the correspondence tables into a RDF serialization format for entry into the BONSAI database.
        
        ## Working procedure
        
        The correspondence tables currently available are stored as received in the folder `data\raw`. The final version after processed to a more usable format are available in the folder `data\final_tables`. This folder also includes descriptors of each table created with the [frictionless data table schema](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/tableschema-py) That contain metadata.  
          
        In order to keep track of what correspondence tables are available, all developments on the correspondence tables (e.g. add new table, change status of existing file etc) shall be reported in the overview file above  [_Overview_of_available_correspondence_files](https://github.com/BONSAMURAIS/Correspondence-tables/blob/master/raw/_Overview_of_available_correspondence_files.csv).
        
        # Overview of vocabulary used
        
        In the RDF framework data is stored as statements of form subject-predicate-object. The existence of a predicate allows a more concise definition of the relation between the classifications. Here we provide an overview of the predicates used in correspondance tables.
        
        **note:** in RDF subject object and predicate have unique identifiers (URIs), that makes the statements wordy for humans. The examples here are provided in Turtle serialization format. We use prefixes to make the sentences more readable.
        
        prefixes:
        - @prefix brdffo: <http://rdf.bonsai.uno/flowobject/us_epa_elem/> .
        - @prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .
        - @prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
        
        **rdfs:label** it may be used to provide a human-readable version of the resource name
        
        e.g. brdffo:Chemical-Structure.11148 rdfs:label "HFC-41" 
        
        This means that what the chemical structure _11148_ is labelled as HFC-41, 
        
        **OWL.SameAs** this predicate indicates that subject and object are the same thing 
        
        e.g. : brdffo:Chemical-Structure.11148 owl:sameAs <http://www.chemspider.com/Chemical-Structure.11148> .
        
        This links the taxonomy of US EPA elementary flows to substances in the chemspider taxonomy. This allows access to a wide wealth of [info](http://www.chemspider.com/Chemical-Structure.11148.html) available in Chemspider for the given substance.
        
        **rdfs:subClassOf**
        
        This means instances of one class are instances of another, e.g. HFC-41 is a subclass of HFC
        
        Also, this predicate can be used to indicate that a class belongs to a specific classifications, such as "ISIC 4".
        
        **bont:superClassOf**
        
        We need to declare this predicate for the BONSAI ontology:
        
        bont:superClassOf owl:inverseOf refs:SuperClassOf
        
        The inverse of rdfs:subClassOf, allowing to import/export a correspondance table between two classifications as a csv-file with 3 columns (classification 1, predicate, Classification 2)
