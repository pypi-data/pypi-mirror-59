# tool-tip / intellisense helpers ---------------------------------------------
# Class initialization is done purely by kwargs. While some # of these can be 
# set to zero by default other MUST be given to make any sense 
# (e.g. magnetization). To improve tool tips and intellisense we inizilize them
# with names, e.g. mag=(Mx, My, Mz). This looks good, but it requires that
# these names are pre-initialzed:
Mx = My = Mz = 0.0

class Dipole(MagMoment):
    """ 
    This class represents a magnetic dipole. The dipole is constructed such that 
    its moment :math:`|M|` is given in :math:`[mT*mm^3]` and corresponds to the moment of a cuboid
    magnet with remanence field Br and Volume V such that :math:`|M| = Br*V`. Scalar
    input is either integer or float. Vector input format can be either list,
    tuple or array of any data type (float, int).


    Parameters
    ----------

    moment : vec3 [mT]
        Set magnetic dipole moment in units of [mT*mm^3].

    pos=[0,0,0] : vec3 [mm]
        Set position of the moment in units of [mm].

    angle=0.0 : scalar [deg]
        Set angle of orientation of the moment in units of [deg].

    axis=[0,0,1] : vec3 []
        Set axis of orientation of the moment.

    Attributes
    ----------

    moment : arr3 [mT]
        Magnetic dipole moment in units of [mT*mm^3] (:math:`|moment| = Br*V` of a
        cuboid magnet.)

    position : arr3 [mm]
        Position of the moment in units of [mm].

    angle : float [deg]
        Angle of orientation of the moment in units of [deg].

    axis : arr3 []
        Axis of orientation of the moment.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> magpylib as magpy
    >>> mom = magpy.source.moment.Dipole(moment=[0,0,1000])
    >>> B = mom.getB([1,0,1])
    >>> print(B)
      [0.33761862  0.  0.11253954]
