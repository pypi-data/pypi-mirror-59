    """
    Create a rotation-enabled sensor to extract B-fields from individual Sources and Source Collections.
    It may be displayed with :class:`~magpylib.Collection`'s :meth:`~magpylib.Collection.displaySystem` using the sensors kwarg.

    Parameters
    ----------
    position : vec3
        Cartesian position of where the sensor is.

    angle : scalar
        Angle of rotation

    axis : vec3
        Rotation axis information (x,y,z)

    Example
    -------
        >>> from magpylib import source, Sensor
        >>> sensor = Sensor([0,0,0],90,(0,0,1)) # This sensor is rotated in respect to space
        >>> cyl = source.magnet.Cylinder([1,2,300],[1,2])

        Parameters
        ----------
        dupWarning : Check if there are any duplicate sources, optional.
            This will prevent duplicates and throw a warning, by default True.

        Returns
