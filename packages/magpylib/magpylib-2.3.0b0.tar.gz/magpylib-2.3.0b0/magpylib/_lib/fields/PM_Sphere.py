# MAGNETIC FIELD CALCULATION FOR SPHERICAL MAGNET IN CANONICAL BASIS


# %% IMPORTS

# %% CALCULATION

# The magnetic field of a spherical magnet with the center in the origin

# MAG = magnetization vector     [mT]  - takes arr3
# pos = position of the observer [mm]  - takes arr3
# D = diameter of sphere         [mm]  - takes float


def Bfield_Sphere(MAG, pos, D):  # returns array, takes (arr3, arr3, float)

    radius = D/2
    r = fastNorm3D(pos)

    if r > radius:
        return radius**3/3*(-MAG/r**3 + 3*fastSum3D(MAG*pos)*pos/r**5)
    elif r == radius:
        warn('Warning: getB Position directly on magnet surface', RuntimeWarning)
        return array([NaN, NaN, NaN])
    else:
        return 2/3*MAG
