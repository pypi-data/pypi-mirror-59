# %% DIPOLE field

# describes the field of a dipole positioned at posM and pointing into the direction of M

# M    : arr3  [mT]    Magnetic moment, M = Âµ0*m
# pos  : arr3  [mm]    Position of observer
# posM : arr3  [mm]    Position of dipole moment

# |M| corresponds to the magnetic moment of a cube with remanence Br and Volume V such that
#       |M| [mT*mm^3]  =  Br[mT] * V[mm^3]
