# Releases

## [2.3.0b] - 2020-01-17

### Changed
- Improved performance of getB for diametral magnetized Cylinders by 20%.
- GetB of Line current now uses vectorized code which leads to massive performance enhancement.
- **IMPORTANT:** position arguments of `getBv` functions have been flipped! First comes the source position POSm THEN the observer position POSo!
- - getB(pos) now takes single AND vector position arguments. If a vector is handed to getB it will automatically execute vectorized code from the vector module.

### Added
- completed the library vector functionality adding magnet Cylinder, moment Dipole, current Circular and Line. This includes adding several private vectorized functions (e.g. ellipticV) to mathLib_vector, adding respective tests and docu examples.

---

## [2.2.0b] - 2019-12-27
- unreleased version

---

## [2.1.0b] - 2019-12-06

### Added
- Docstrings for vector functions.
- displaySystem kwarg `figsize`
- bringing documentation up to speed

### Fixes
- init file bug

---

## [2.0.0b] - 2019-11-29
### Changed
- Restructuring
  - displaySystem is now a top-level function, not a Collection method anymore.
  - getBsweep and multiprocessing options have been completely removed, this functionality
    should be overtaken by the new vector functionality which uses the numpy native vectorized 
    code paradigm. If mkl library is set (test by numpy.show_config()) numpy will also 
    automatically use multiporcessing. Code parallelization at magpylib level should be done
    by hand.
- Docstrings are adjusted to work better with intellisense. (Problems with *.rst code)
- public rotatePosition() is now called angleAxisRotation(), former private angleAxisRotation
    is now called angleAxisRotation_priv().
- Major rework of the documentation and examples.

### Added
- Performance computation trough vector functionality included in new top-level subpackge "vector"
- Vectorized versions of math functions added to "math" subpackage

---

## [1.2.1b0] - 2019-07-31
### Changed
- Optimized getB call (utility integrated)
- Improved Documentation (added Sensor class v1)

---

## [1.2.0b0] - 2019-07-16
### Added
- Sensor Class
  - This allows users to create a coordinate system-enabled Sensor object, which can be placed, rotated, moved and oriented. 
  - This object can take the B-Field of a system (be it single source or a Collection) with the added functionality of having its own reference in the coordinate space, allowing users to easily acquire relative B-Field measurements of a system from an arbitrarily placed sensor object. 
  - Sensors in a list may be displayed in the `Collection.displaySystem()` by using the `sensors` keyword argument.
- Added content to the `__repr__` builtin to all source classes for quick console evaluations, simply call a defined object in your Python shell to print out its attributes.
### Changed
- Edge cases in field calculations now return a proper [RuntimeWarning](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#RuntimeWarning) instead of console prints
### Fixed
- Unused imports and variables

---

## [1.1.1b0] - 2019-06-25
### Added 
- Changelog
### Changed
- Change `Collection.displaySystem()` not having the `block=False` setting for matplotlib's `pyplot.show()` by default, this meant that outside interactive mode calling this function would hang the script until the plot was closed.
  - If for some reason you want to block the application, you may still use `Collection.displaySystem()`'s `suppress=True` kwarg then call pyplot.show() normally. 
  - This should cause no API changes, if you have problems please notify us.

### Fixed
- Fix multiprocessing enabled `Collection.getBsweep()` for lots of objects with few positions causing great performance loss. This functionality now behaves as expected for the use case.
- Fix `Collection.displaySystem()`'s drawing of Dipole objects in external axes (plots) using the `subplotAx` kwarg crashing the application. This functionality now behaves as expected for the use case.

---

## [1.1.0b0] - 2019-06-14
### Added
- Implemented one new kwarg for `Collection.displaySystem()`:

    > `subplotAx=None`
        Draw into a subplot axe that already exists. The subplot needs to be 3D projected
        
  This allows for creating side-by-side plots using displaySystem.
  Figure information must be set manually in pyplot.figure() in order to not squash the plots upon subplotting.

### Changed

- `getBsweep()` for Collections and Sources now always returns a numpy array
- Zero-length segments in Line sources now return `[0,0,0]` and a warning, making it easier to draw spirals without letting users do this unaware.

### Fixed
- Added a workaround fix for a rotation bug we are still working on.
