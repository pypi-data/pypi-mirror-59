# PDM - Python Development Master

A modern Python package manager with PEP 582 support.

![Github Actions](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)

## What is PDM?

PDM is meant to be a next generation Python package management tool.
It is originally built for personal interest. If you feel you are going well
with `Pipenv` or `Poetry` and don't want to introduce another package manager,
just stick to it. But if you are missing something that is not present in those tools,
you can probably find some goodness in `pdm`.

**Open for feature requests, find yourself at https://github.com/pdm-project/call-for-features.**

## Installation:

```bash
$ pipx install pdm
```
It is recommended to install `pdm` in an isolated enviroment, with `pipx`.

Or you can install it under user site:

```bash
$ pip install --user pdm
```

## Usage

`python -m pdm --help` should be a good guidance.
