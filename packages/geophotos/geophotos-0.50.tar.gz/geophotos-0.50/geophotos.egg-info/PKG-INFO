        # What is **GeoPhotos**?
        
        Initially
        
        **GeoPhotos** is a Python library designed to make it easy to pull coordinates
        from various sources, analyze them in order to obtain useful information, and
        plot them on a map.
        
        ## Main features
        
        An overview of some of the major features of **GeoPhotos** are as follows:
        
        * Extract metadata (timestamp, coordinates, etc.) from one or more files, and
          write to a csv file if desired
        * Pull coordinates from Google Takeout location history
        * Plot coordinate data on a fully customizable heatmap, including markers,
          tooltips, layer control, and more
        * Analyze coordinate data to determine unique countries, most common countries,
          and more
        * Highlight certain countries on the heatmap easily and painlessly
        * Save the map to an html file for reference or for use with web development
          frameworks such as *flask*
        * Open the html file directly from the code for debugging
        
        # How to get it
        
        ## Dependencies
        
        ### Required dependencies
        
        Currently, the following packages are required:
        
        * [pillow](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow)
        * [folium](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium)
        * [osgeo](https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal)
        
        Some packages that are currently required may be made optional in the future,
        such as the [gdal/osgeo](https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal) package.
        
        ### Optional Dependencies
        
        The [geopandas](https://github.com/geopandas/geopandas) package has been made
        optional due to how difficult it is to install properly. It is required to
        perform geographical data analysis.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Assuming you've already got the dependencies covered, you can use pip to install
        this package:
        
        ```
        pip install geophotos
        ```
        
        However, you will most likely run into problems doing it this way.
        Unfortunately, I have tried and failed to overcome these obstacles myself.
        My recommendation is to install geopandas using Anaconda/conda (you might have
        to install gdal as well), and then pip install it into your current environment:
        
        ```
        conda install geopandas
        conda install gdal
        pip install geophotos
        ```
        
        This should handle all of the dependencies for you, although you still might run
        into some issues (I sure did!).
        
        ## Updating
        
        To update *geophotos* to the latest version, simply use the command:
        
        ```
        pip install --upgrade geophotos
        ```
        
        # Example usage
        
        ## Heatmap from photo locations
        
        One of the main reasons I made this package was to pull GPS information from the
        pictures in my iCloud library, then plot them on a map. Skipping the pulling of
        the coordinates for simplicity's sake, the following code does the following:
        
        1. Read latitudes and longitudes from a csv file
        2. Generate a heatmap using this coordinate data
        3. Add a marker that marks my hometown
        4. Analyze the data and determine which countries I've visited
        5. Highlight only the countries I've been to on a separate layer
        6. Save the map as an html file and open it in a web browser
        
        The html file is completely interactive, and I hope to eventually use it on my
        personal website.
        
        ```python
        import geophotos as gp
        
        # Read coordinate data from csv
        data = gp.coordinates_from_csv(r'coordinates.csv', 2, 3)
        # Initialize the Map object
        nys_center = [42.965000, -76.016667]
        heatmap = gp.Map(location=nys_center, zoom_start=7)
        # Feed the Heatmap object the coordinates
        heatmap.coordinates = data
        # Create the heatmap
        heatmap.create_heatmap(max_zoom=10, min_opacity=0.05, radius=13, blur=25,
                               name='Photo Heatmap')
        # Add a marker to the heatmap
        hamburg_ny = [42.715746, -78.829416]
        heatmap.add_marker(location=hamburg_ny,
                           tooltip='<strong>Hamburg, NY</strong><br>Hometown')
        # Analyze the data to determine which countries are unique
        analyzer = gp.Analyzer(data)
        unique_countries = analyzer.unique_countries(),
        # Use the data to determine which countries to highlight
        border_layer = gp.CountryLayer(unique_countries, name='Countries Visited')
        border_layer.add_to(heatmap)
        # Add layer control functionality to the map
        heatmap.add_layer_control()
        # Save the heatmap and open it in a browser
        heatmap.save_html('sample.html', open_html=True)
        ```

        ## Heatmap from Google Takeout location history
        
        Another thing I wanted to do when starting this project was be able to analyze
        my Google Takeout location data. While not an overly complicated thing to do
        without **GeoPhotos**, it does make this process very simple.
        
        For example, the following code extracts coordinate information from the Google
        Takeout location history JSON file and plots them on a heatmap. It's really
        interesting to see where you've been the most.
        
        ```python
        import geophotos as gp
        
        # Read coordinate data from the location history file
        data = gp.coordinates_from_google_takeout_json(r'locationhistory.json')
        # Initialize the Map object
        nys_center = [42.965000, -76.016667]
        heatmap = gp.Map(location=nys_center, zoom_start=7)
        # Feed the Heatmap object the coordinates
        heatmap.coordinates = data
        # Create the heatmap
        heatmap.create_heatmap(max_zoom=14, min_opacity=0.05, radius=13, blur=25)
        # Save the heatmap and open it in a browser
        heatmap.save_html(r'locationhistory.html', open_html=True)
        ```
        
        <p align="center">
