# License

The license choosen for this project it the LGPLv3. It was choosen instead of the GPLv3 because : 

> The license allows developers and companies to use and integrate a software component released under the LGPL into their own (even proprietary) software without being required by the terms of a strong copyleft license to release the source code of their own components. However, any developer who modifies an LGPL-covered component is required to make their modified version available under the same LGPL license.

# Local tests

If you plan to make some upgrades and test them, here is how to process :

* Edit your changes in the code
* Run the clean and build command: 

```
make

# Releasing 

The version number is automatically get from git thanks to the setuptools_scm library. So you have no version to set in the code.

To create a new release, just create a tag and push it to Gitlab. The CI/CD pipeline will build a release and publish it to Pypi. This is just magic ;). You can check the .gitlab-ci.yml file to understand how it works.
